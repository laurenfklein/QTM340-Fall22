The Office of Student Conduct placed Emory's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) on interim suspensionafter an incident involving alcohol and possible hazing, according to a Feb. 18 University statement.Residence Life staff responded to the incident at 17 Eagle Row, the A EPi house, on Feb. 12. AEPinational headquarters placed the chapter on cease and desist the next day, the University statementsaid.The Office of Student Conduct's investigation is "separate" but "parallel" to the national headquarters'investigation. The Student Conduct investigation is reviewing the "health and safety of the studentsinvolved," according to the statement.Interfraternity Council President Alex Dobosh (20B) wrote in a Feb. 19 email to Emory fraternity members that hazing would not be tolerated."I understand the importance of tradition. I understand the importance of building connection around the rituals of our fraternities. However, there is no tradition or bonding activity that should make individuals feel unsafe or degraded," Dobosh wrote. " It is unfortunate to see chapters suspended as a result ofhazing."Emory's anti-hazing policy states that "Emory University prohibits hazing of any kind."Former AEPi President Michael Silver (20B), who served as the chapter's president between January and February 2019, declined to comment. Acting AEPi President John Stark (21B) also declined tocomment, directing the Wheel to the national headquarters, which did not respond.Last month, former AEPi President Joel Sharpe (20B) was arrested and charged with possession ofcocaine. Sharpe received medical amnesty for Emory code of conduct violations because he was seeking medical attention for an intoxicated individual, his attorney previously told the Wheel. Criminalcharges against Sharpe are still pending.The post AEPi Suspended After Possible Hazing appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
