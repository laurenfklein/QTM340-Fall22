Boba Theory, a drinks shop, is set to open at Emory Point on Dec. 19, according to owner Hien Huynh.Boba Theory's first and only other location is in Morrow, Ga., which opened in late 2016.Huynh said he is opening a new location at Emory Point because he wants his business to be close to Emory and its student population."There's nothing around [this area] that provides the bob a tea and desserts, and I'm hoping to provide that need for students," Huynh said.Huynh said Bob a Theory's menu integrates American flavors with the bob a tea and also contains other products like smoothies, slushies, coffee and frappuccinos."Our theory behind it is that we can integrate all of the drinks together in one place," Huynh said. "[It's] a combination of everything."The restaurant is opening for friends and neighbors on Dec. 16 by invitation, Huynh said, and will offer them free drinks so that they can provide feedback."Different regions require different taste," Huynh said. "We learn from our clients, and then we will start introducing new things."Huynh said he is working with Uber Eats to establish a delivery program for Bob a Theory, but he doesn'texpect delivery service to be ready by opening day.The store is currently hiring new employees, and the training process will begin after this week. Huynhsaid he is looking for Emory students to work at the restaurant.Josh Byland (20C) said he often visits Kung Fu Tea, Sweet Hut and Tea House Formosa for boba, but they are not in close proximity to Emory's campus."Since [Boba Theory is] in walking distance, I'm gonna visit it for sure," Byland said.Cassandra Wan (22C) expressed similar sentiments as Byland."I haven't been to another Boba Theory location, but since I've moved to Atlanta, I've driven past that one a couple times and I always want to check it out," Wan said.The post Boba Theory to Open at Point appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
