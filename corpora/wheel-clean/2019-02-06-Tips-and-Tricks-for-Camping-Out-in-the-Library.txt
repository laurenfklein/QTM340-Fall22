Take one, or a few, but beware the butterscotch sweets that can induce an upset stomach. IfPeet's Coffee and Tea closes and you have more than 10 pages of writing left on your essay, the B school candy bowl can provide you with the necessary energy to power through the final stretch. Or, ifscarfing down candy isn't your thing, you can curb that kleptomania and stock up on the pencils and paper clips near printers throughout the library.This is the TeaBring an empty cup and a tea bag with you to club libs if you want to BYOT (bring your own tea). You can get hot water from Peet's for free, or, if you'd rather not interact with people, fill up your cup at the water fountain and heat it in the microwave on the study-area side of Peet's.Find Your ZenAll-nighters are a rite of passage in the college experience.
