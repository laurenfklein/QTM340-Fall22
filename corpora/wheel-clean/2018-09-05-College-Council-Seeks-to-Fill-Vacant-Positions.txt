He said that he only did so after he was reassured by CC adviser Sarah Beth Potter that he would still be able to accomplish the initiatives he outlined during his campaign."I thought it would have been unethical not to," Duggireddy said.Duggireddy is working to establish a website for research opportunities sponsored by CC, and he expects the website to go live this fall.Prasad said he and Kadakia hope to select a diverse slate of new legislators."What we're looking for in legislators is a diverse perspective from different parts of campus because wedon't just want one type of legislator," Prasad said. "We want legislators that inform all the differentexperiences. We always appreciate people with fresh new ideas and a game plan to get there."After Kadakia and Prasad send offers to applicants, the candidates will be brought before the CC forapproval.Prasad expects to fill the empty positions by the time of freshman representative elections.The post College Council Seeks to Fill Vacant Positions appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
