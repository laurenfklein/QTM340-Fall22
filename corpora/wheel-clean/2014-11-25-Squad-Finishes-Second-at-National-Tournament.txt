After a7-0 deficit, the Eagles battled the score to 10-7, but the Flying Dutch rallied to finish the set 15-8.“I don’t think we’ve met a team that fought as hard as we did and that’s really what we came up against[with Hope],” senior outside hitter Leah Jacobs said in a post-game NCAA press conference uploaded byhost Christopher Newport College (Va.). “It was just two of the best teams in the country fighting for whatever they can get.”Overall, the Flying Dutch out hit the Eagles, topping their .195 attack percentage with one of .238 and making them only the second team to do so this season.Without senior middle Cat McGrath, who caught the no rovirus and was unable to play in the match, onthe court, Maher took the offensive helm for the Eagles, bringing in a career-high 21 kills and career-tying14 digs.
