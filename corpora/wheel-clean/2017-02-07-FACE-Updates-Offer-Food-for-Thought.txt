Food Advisory Committee at Emory (FACE) fielded concerns from students regarding food trucklocation blunders, and informed students about new campus-wide food options at Emory Dining thissemester at its first monthly town hall of the semester Feb. 2."Pasta Johns" moved from Cox Hall to Dobbs Market, and the "Authentic" section in Dobbs Marketbegan offering traditional international dishes, due to student survey feedback asking for both more pastaand authentic food in Dobb's Market. Emory Dining made the changes over winter break, ExecutiveCampus Chef Michelle Reuter told about 30 people in Winship Ballroom.Meanwhile, construction of the DUC-ling prompted food truck location changes. A student voicedconcerns that food trucks weren't parking in their designated locations. Associate Director of CampusDining Chad Sunstein said fewer food trucks will be parking in their usual location near the James W.Wagner Freshman Quadrangle, due to difficulty of maneuvering through the DUC-ling construction site.To fill the freshman quad food truck void, trucks will park near Harris Hall and Complex Hall, Sunsteinsaid.The Dobbs University Center (DUC) will be demolished over the summer, and Emory Dining is currently searching for a new temporary or permanent venue for Mama Tiger, an Asian cuisine restaurant located on the DUC's first floor, Sunstein said.The associate director also said the DUC-ling is on schedule to open Summer 2017.FACE Co-chairs and College seniors Samantha Goodman and Katarina Bartel described changes tocampus-wide dining locations. The new food options include Dobb's Market dining stations and Ray'sPizza locations at the George and Irene Woodruff Residential Center and Cox Hall.At Dobbs Market, "Pasta Johns" replaced the "Global" section; the "Comfort" station is renamed"Southern Mains" but serves similar food as the "Comfort" station; the "Grill" now serves curly fries andmashed potatoes; the "Authentic" station serving traditional international food is at the former "Vegan"station; and the "Vegan" station is now next to "Southern Mains."Goodman and Bartel also said that Ray's is the only on-campus dining location that delivers food daily to any building on Emory's Atlanta campus from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m., noting that there is a $15 minimumdelivery order.After receiving comments that the new DUC stations tasted better than last semester's stations, as well as some criticism that Highland Bakery did not provide adequate amounts of avocado in its sandwiches and that Ray's Pizza at Woodruff needed more healthy meal-swipe food options, Goodman and Bartelthanked attendees for their comments and said they would inform dining representatives of theconcerns.FACE and Emory Dining collaborate to implement the changes students suggest from FACE meetingsand survey responses from undergraduates, Sunstein said, adding that more than 2,000 studentsanswer each annual survey.Goizueta Business School junior Josh Patashnik said he attended the meeting because he wants Kaldi'sCoffee to serve pumpkin bread year-round instead of seasonally."I feel passionately about getting pumpkin bread at Kaldi's," Patashnik said. "I thought [the recent diningchanges] were incredibly nice, and I can't wait to see updates on pumpkin bread."
