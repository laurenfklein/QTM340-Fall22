Emory women's basketball Head Coach Christy Thomaskutty has resigned, she announced Oct. 5.Thomaskutty led the Eagles to a 187-166 overall record during her 14-year tenure. She posted recordseasons for wins in 2012-2013, consecutive wins in 2013-2014 (14 in a row) and Emory's highest-everWomen's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) ranking at No. 7 for the 2013-14 season.Thomaskutty resigned as a result of health issues, according to an Oct. 5 Emory Athletics pressrelease. She told Emory Athletics that she is "fine and doing well," but that health issues "have left [her]without the energy needed to coach these young women at the level which they deserve."Assistant Coach Misha Jackson (13C) replaced Thomaskutty as interim head coach for the 2017-2018season. Jackson played for the Eagles from 2011-2013 and was promoted from volunteer assistant tofull-time assistant coach for the 2013-2014 season."I can't think of a more deserving person than [Jackson] to take over the coaching duties and to represent Emory University," Thomaskutty said.Jackson, an Atlanta native, was selected for the first WBCA "Thirty Under 30" list of upcoming women'sbasketball coaches in 2016. Nevertheless, replacing Thomaskutty is no small task. Jackson said it was a "surprise" and that she is "sad to see her go." Thomaskutty was a "huge part of the program,"according to Jackson."At first it was a little nerve-wracking, but I was lucky to learn under Coach Thomaskutty," Jackson said of her new position.Junior center Ashley Oldshue, who started all 25 games last season, said that Thomaskutty's departurewas "shocking because [she knew] how dedicated [Thomaskutty] was to the program." Oldshuebelieves the coaching change is a good one, citing her close relationship with Jackson, who was previously her position coach.Jackson faces a season without any senior players, but Oldshue said, "I feel really good; it's weird not to have seniors, but the sophomores are stepping up."Emory women's basketball begins their season at home against the Rhodes College (Tenn.)
