It has been more than one year since 2016 Olympics hopeful and impending 2017 Emory graduateAndrew Wilson has stepped into an Emory classroom, but the university and its community have stayed a part of his daily regimen.Two or three times a week, Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Mathematics Ken Ono Skypes with Wilson— an activity that Ono does not typically do with his students — and reviews a myriad of topics,including graduate-level algebra problem sets and Wilson's honors thesis that he will begin when he returns to Emory in Fall 2016.Ono and Wilson met when Wilson enrolled in Ono's Foundations of Mathematics course, in which Wilsonnotched a perfect score on the final exam. Wilson later selected Ono as his thesis adviser after the former was invited to join the math department's honors program."I chose Ken because I had a good relationship with him, I really liked him and I was really interested in all of the stuff that he was doing," Wilson said.Wilson's thesis topic will potentially entail rogue waves, cryptography, information security or computervision. The weekly problem sets and thesis preparations are the type of intellectual stimulation thatEmory Swimming and Diving Head Coach Jon Howell believes is integral to Wilson's success in thepool."There are athletes out there that can be athletes 24/7 — and that makes them better," Howell said. "Ithink for Andrew, being an athlete 24/7 is a negative for him. With Andrew, the academic constantactually makes him a better swimmer."***If you've watched any collegiate sporting event in the past few years, then you have probably seen theNCAA advertisements of student-athletes with a pencil in ear, eagerly raising their hands in a classroom,or the advertisements of student-athletes in lab coats, looking intently into a microscope, all with the reassuring voiceover of a man with the conviction that "the NCAA has helped millions of athletes findpower outside of the field, court and rink," or that "just about all of [NCAA's student-athletes] will go pro in something other than sports."But, to Ono, it's all a farce. Rarely are famous student-athletes in prominent sports programs actually going to class, he said."I don't want to be cynical about this," Ono says, "but if you're a sports fan, you probably see the sports ads that the NCAA puts on during college football season with these famous guys who are famousathletes, and they put chemistry goggles on and stuff — you know they're not in that class. That's not how it actually works."In the wake of leaving Emory — and the mental stimulation that an institution of higher learning provides— for one year to prepare for tomorrow's Olympic trials, Wilson has realized that he succeeds best in the pool when he is not only an athlete, but also a student.***Four years ago, Wilson could not have fathomed that he would be in his current situation: one day from the Olympic trials that will determine if he will make the United States Swim Team for the 2016 SummerOlympics in Rio de Janeiro."[If, in 2012, you told me that I would be preparing for the Olympics], I would have laughed at you and told you no way," Wilson said. "I just never thought I'd be at this level … but making the Olympic team would be a dream come true."And yet, here he is, with the chance to sport the recently unveiled star-spangled, red, white and bluespeedos for Team USA in August.The formerly "slow and inexperienced" — in Wilson's own words — swimmer is No. 1 in the 100-meterbreaststroke and No. 6 in the 200-meter breaststroke among American swimmers this year. Finishing in the top two in either the 100 or 200-meter breaststrokes during the June 26 to July 3 Olympic trials inOmaha, Neb., would earn Wilson a spot on the U.S. team.If Wilson is able to make the United States' Olympic swim team, he will have achieved an accolade to which only he can claim. According to The Washington Post, an informal survey conducted by U.S.Olympic historians suggests that if Wilson qualifies for 2016's Team USA at this week's trials, he would become the first Division-III swimmer to make the team since the NCAA split into three bodies in 1973.Once an unheralded swimmer and water polo player from Philips Academy in Andover, Mass., Wilson was forced to be proactive and persistent in his pursuit of swimming at the collegiate level."Andrew met with me the summer before his senior year and expressed some interest in swimming atEmory," Howell said. "I gave him some time standards that I felt were appropriate for him to try to hit his senior year, and he was pretty persistent in contacting me, which was good."Wilson was ultimately unable to hit the time standards, but with two potential Emory swimmers decidingon different programs, Howell decided to take a much closer look at Wilson."We had a couple other guys that were really good and faster than any one we had in those events, so we were actively pursuing those guys, but at the end of the day, none of those guys ended up coming toEmory," Howell said. "So, we circled back around, and we vetted Andrew by talking to a few of his former coaches, and talking to them confirmed my gut feeling — that he's a great kid who works hard and is motivated."After a comprehensive vetting process, Wilson ultimately obtained a spot on Emory's swimming team."It took a little persistence on his part. We got lucky, he got lucky — it all worked out," Howell said.Emory was Wilson's top choice, and the only school to which he applied."I applied early decision … and I got in in December so I didn't look at any other schools for swimming,"Wilson said.For Wilson, persistence and perseverance have been attributes that have fueled him throughout his life— traits that motivated him to continue his athletic career, devour complex applied number theoryproblem sets and are traits that have aided him on his route to the Olympics.***Everything changed for Wilson, in Howell's eyes, during his freshman year's winter training trip in between his first and second semesters at Emory."He did a couple sets down there that were really, really exciting, and he was still learning and still developing at that point, but there were a couple times during that training trip where I thought, 'Wow thiskid could really be the real deal,' " Howell said.However, Howell did not anticipate Wilson's rise to meteoric levels of swimming prominence."But again, at that point, my mind didn't think, 'Hey, he could make the Olympic team.' My mind at that point was that he could be a really good Division-III swimmer and swim at the national level for us. He'staken it a lot further than I thought he would have at that point."From that trip onwards, Wilson only continued to impress scouts, coaches and teammates, culminatingin a record-setting time of 59.65 in the 100-meter breaststroke during his junior season that announced his arrival on the national stage.With the record-setting time, Wilson had coaches from Division-I programs across the country salivating.NCAA rules stipulate that athletes who transfer from a D-III to a D-I program do not have to sit out for any period of time, as is necessary for a D-I to D-I transfer. Wilson could have easily transferred to a topDivision-I program and begun training immediately.But after serious deliberation, Wilson's intellectual curiosity superseded any attempts from UC Berkeley,UCLA, the University of Georgia and Stanford (Calif.) to recruit him simply for his swimming prowess."Andrew was very, very thoughtful in deciding what he wants out of life and at the end of the day he said:'You know, what's the point of transferring to a big state school just because they have a great swimmingprogram when that would mean I would lose out on the opportunity to write a nationally competitivehonors thesis in mathematics? That's not worth it,' " Ono said.After spending the following summer training at the University of Texas, Wilson decided to leave school for the year to train exclusively at the University for the Olympic trials.Wilson did not realize that the absence of the rigor of school work perpetually looming behind him would affect his performance in the water."He spent the first semester at Texas really just being a swimmer, and really struggled with that," Howellsaid. "He really realized that he needed a balanced approach to life — he needed that intellectualstimulation, and Ken Ono was really helpful with that."Though Wilson is chasing his dream through his training in Texas, he remains steadfast in his desire to come back to Emory to graduate in 2017, and also does not fully know how he feels about the fact that his peers graduated this past May while he was training for the Olympic trials."Yeah, it's kind of weird that I should be out in the real world right now, but I'm totally fine with holding off on that for another year," Wilson said."Of course I miss Emory."***"[Wilson's] a very cerebral guy," Ono said. "That's really the right word for it."Ono would provide Wilson weekly with books related to his honors thesis and problem sets of graduatelevel algebra that Wilson would do on his own.During his year of training at the University of Texas, Wilson finished one full year of graduate levelalgebra in three and a half months."You probably won't meet many potential Olympians — and I don't mean Olympic trial hopefuls, I meanOlympic trial favorites — who are firing at such a high level outside of the pool, academically," Ono said.In a few weeks, after the trials, Wilson and Ono will go over 10-12 research papers to narrow down what direction they want to take Wilson's thesis paper.The student-teacher relationship goes beyond their discussions of mathematics or swimming. The two have developed a rapport that has allowed them to know each like a mentor knows a mentee, and viceversa. Recently, they have discussed in length "Wilson's main goal in life:" to become a world-classmathematical scientist or university professor."Andrew is beyond a student-athlete," Ono said. "Someone like that is not supposed to exist. In fact, he'sbad in that way — he's not a great role model for some one like my own son because it doesn't seem that someone should be gifted in that many ways."
