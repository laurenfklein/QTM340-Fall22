Zoberman mentionedthat SGA has spent $3,000 to fund the same campus-to-airport shuttle service for previous holidays,such as this past Thanksgiving.Vice President (VP) for Finance and College senior Patrick O’Leary said the Finance Committee had approved the bill by a 5-2-1 vote. SGA then passed the bill by a unanimous vote.O’Leary then submitted Bill 48sl23, which would require clubs to provide justification for at least 70percent of the funds that they request during the club budgeting process, over which the SGA VP ofFinance presides. The bill also would require all anticipated events to be included in the club’s submittedbudget.The SGA voted unanimously to table the bill until a later meeting.Lastly, SGA Student Life Committee Chair and College junior Elyse Lee submitted Bill 48sl21, which would create a VP of International Student Life position.The establishment of this role would allow for the SGA to better represent the undergraduate studentbody, of which roughly 20 percent are international, according to the Emory Office of UndergraduateAdmission. None of the representatives in SGA are international students.The SGA voted unanimously to table this bill as well.
