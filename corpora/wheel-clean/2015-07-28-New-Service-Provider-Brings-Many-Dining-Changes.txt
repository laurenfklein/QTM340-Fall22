Emory students will discover new food and venues when they arrive on campus in August. With the change from Sodexo to Bon Appetit as Emory's food service provider, numerous dining changes are focused on diversifying food options and offering more local, sustainable food, according to Senior Director of Dining David Furhman.The Dobbs Market in the Dobbs University Center (DUC) will have a completely updated menu this fall,Furhman said, and will offer more vegan and vegetarian options, global flavors and will "have a tenaciousfocus on local and sustainable food." He also noted that this will bring the University closer to their goal,where 75 percent of food will be locally produced.Several venues at Cox Dining Hall will have changed names and food selection. Boar's Head Deli, forexample, will now be "ITP (Inside the Perimeter) Deli" and will no longer serve sushi. ITP Deli's menu willoffer new sandwich combinations and additional sides such as jam. All soups at ITP deli will be made from scratch on site. Maru, the new name for Star Ginger, will take up the sushi making role. Maru will also serve ramen noodle bowls and hot entrees such as orange chicken.Pasta John's will keep its name but will now offer two ready-to-serve baked past as every day. This will speed up the process when people don't have time to order customized pastas, Furhman said. Dooley'sGrill will become "Char'd House" and will serve 100 percent grass-fed beef. Beltline Pizza will make allpizza dough from scratch every day.The convenience store at Cox will be replaced by a grab-and-go emporium offering home made hot and cold items for students and staff in a hurry, according to Furhman.The Green Bean will keep its name, but will offer an improved quality of baked goods and will bake all goods on site, Furhman said."I'm really excited about [the dining changes]," Furhman said, "We've been working really hard to make this a world class dining program, and I think we are on the verge of greatness."Downstairs in the DUC, Dunkin Donuts will be replaced by Kaldi's Coffee, a premium coffee roaster andartisan bakery. In addition to various coffees and teas, Kaldis will offer a variety of sandwiches and salads made to order. They will also offer baked goods that will all be baked on site, according toFurhman."This was a direct response to our campus community telling us 'we like Dunkin Donuts and their coffee,but we really don't love donuts'," Furhman said, explaining that students expressed their desire to have"real food" offered at that location.Furhman also said that Kaldi's, a smaller company than Dunkin Donuts, was willing to work with Emory to create a specialized menu that would fit with students' needs. The University is also requiring that the premium coffee roaster only serve fair trade coffee, according to Furhman.As for Eagle Convenience and Subs in the DUC, the only changes will be offering a larger selection and variety of foods. Products from the Emory Farmers Market will be sold at Eagle Convenience. Beginningthis fall, students will be able to use their Dooley Dollars to make purchases at the Farmers Market,Furhman noted.Other dining changes include a second Highland Bakery location and updated, healthier menus at the Student Activity and Academics Center (SAAC) and Woodruff Residential Center. Emory's secondHighland Bakery will be located in the newly renovated chemistry building. This location will be a smaller version than the one in the business school and will offer coffees and baked goods but not hot entrees.Last but not least, Dooley's Depot will no longer be Zaya. The menu will be reminiscent of Zaya but not the same, according to Furhman. He added that the quality of food will be exponentially better.Although the overall theme of dining changes is increased quality and locally produced food, Furhman said that there shouldn't be any increase in pricing."We asked Bon Appetit to make sure to keep the prices the same as or very close to what they had previously been," Furhman said. "The only thing we want our community to notice is really great food."
