The Emory women’s team beat the Panthers 379 to 49 points. Rhodes’ team did not place,only having one athlete compete.“Birmingham is a relatively new program, and I commend them for coming after our team,” seniorMckenna Newsum-Schoenberg said. “They didn’t have their whole team there, and we did, so we definitely had the advantage. But, it was a fun, cool environment to have everyone cheering for eachother, no matter which team. It was a supportive environment to get some last cuts before the NCAAs.”The Emory Invite was the last chance to get cut times for the NCAAs. Emory invited Birmingham so that the cut times would count for the NCAA, not necessarily to compete with the Panthers, sophomoreDavid Tao said.“The main focus was getting those cut times, not to compete against Birmingham,” he said. “Now thatpeople gained those cuts, practices are going to go up [in intensity] for a little, but before the NCAAs we will calm down a bit and rest for the competition.”Emory also racked up 17 NCAA ‘B’ cut times at their last meet before going into the NCAAChampionships next month.Seven Eagles on the men’s team captured the ‘B’ cut times. Freshman Michael Grenon and junior JohnGalvin led with two ‘B’ cut times each. In the 100-yard backstroke timed trial, Grenon swam in 56.51seconds, and got his time down for the finals, coming in first with a time of 56.30 seconds. In the 200yard butterfly timed trial, Galvin swam a 1:51.82, and also got his time down for the finals, winning with a time of 1:50.17. Many freshmen added the other ‘B’ cut times.

Plus, everyoneelse is working just as hard as us so it will be a challenge.”Emory’s divers will be back in action on Friday and Saturday in San Antonio, Texas for the NCAARegion Two Diving Championships.
