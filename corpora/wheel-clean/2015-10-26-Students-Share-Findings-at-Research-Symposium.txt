There are humanities and creative arts researchposters in addition to natural science posters," Hue said.This "disciplinary diversity" is truly something Hue strives for and is proud to be a part of creating.College seniors Sean Kelley and Katie Boice were two of the many students that presented at thesymposium.Kelley and Boice conducted research projects in different fields and found their experiences to be veryrewarding.Kelley applied cognitively based compassion training (CBCT), "a secular derivative of Tibetan Buddhistmind training designed to increase empathic and altruistic feelings towards others," to second-yearEmory medical students.According to Kelley, medical students often experience a decline in empathy and psychosocial wellbeing throughout their medical training, which can be potentially detrimental given that patients provide more information and have better treatment out comes when being treated by more empatheticphysicians.Consequently, Kelley and his research colleagues wanted to know if CBCT had a discernible effect onsecond-year medical students.Kelley found that, overall, CBCT decreased loneliness and stress in medical students.Boice, on the other hand, studied psychology.According to Boice, she used a SIR E independent research grant to investigate the causes of differences in sex in performance in spatial and mathematical tasks.Boice discovered that females with lower working memories displayed stereotypical behavior on spatial and mathematical tasks compared to females with higher working memories.Kelley and Boice worked in very different research environments and both truly enjoyed the work that they did."Because of research I have improved my ability to think of complex and multi-faceted issues as well as approach problems from a variety of angles," Kelley said. "It is incredibly gratifying, after months of work,to make conclusions and interpretations from the results and place them into the broader scientificliterature. For this project in particular, I very much enjoyed working on a project with direct real-worldapplications that could potentially improve quality of patient-physician interaction."Boice also appreciates that she can contribute to research literature and apply her findings to real worldapplications."My participation in undergraduate research at Emory has allowed me to narrow my interests and feel more confident in my ability to understand and produce scientific literature that can benefit the field ofpsychology," Boice said. "More meaningfully, it has facilitated lasting relationships with my advisor and graduate students as they've mentored and supported my growth as a researcher."Some of the other project titles included, "Effects of Maternal Depressive Symptoms on Consistency ofEEG Patterns in Infants," "Finding Common RNA Expressions among Yeast Strains That Survive Betterin Low pH" and "Assessing the 'Safety' of Dietary DDT: The 1950s Atlanta Penitentiary Studies."Overall, the participants of the symposium were enthusiastic to share their research with fellow scholars,students and parents.These undergraduates have found research to be a very rewarding experience, and one of the goals of the symposium was to give students who were not sure whether or not to get involved with research a chance to learn about peers' findings as well as other students' positive experiences working in a multitude of disciplines.
