"[Weare trying to] put Emory soccer at the top of Division-III and of the country."Ricketts, 39, played 12 years of professional soccer across several leagues throughout the world.He found the most success in the MLS, specifically with the Portland Timbers and with the Los AngelesGalaxy, where he won the MLS Cup (2011), the MLS's Defensive Player of the Year (2009) and theMLS's Goalkeeper of the Year (2010).Ricketts' tenure in Portland yielded a second of both the Defensive Player of the Year and theGoalkeeper of the Year awards in 2013.To couple his professional awards, Ricketts has notched 100 international caps with the Jamaicannational team and aided heavily in the team's 2005 and 2008 victories at the Caribbean Cup.Ricketts last played for the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2015. This will be the first coaching position that Ricketts has undertaken in his career."I can still remember how I was as a young 20-year-old goalkeeper," Ricketts told the Wheel over e-mail."Now I'm armed with that experience of a kid trying to make it coupled with my experience from playingprofessionally."Ricketts' championship background made him the perfect man for the coaching job."We had some good applicants for the job that I think would have come in and become a solid addition,but as soon as Donovan Ricketts' name was in the mix, there was no question that he was our numberone," Travis said.Ricketts and Emory were connected by Jeff Solem, an Emory soccer team alumnus and friend ofRicketts. Emory and Ricketts were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement — the so ccerprogram acquires the expertise of an international and MLS star, while Ricketts gets to launch his coaching career close to his native home in Jamaica."[The team is] going to be very open-minded about what his experiences have been at the highest level of the game," Travis said. "We want to continue to seek a national championship, and this is a guy who can talk about championships."The hiring comes at a pivotal time for the program. With the graduation of Abe Hannigan, the competition for the starting goalkeeper position is wide open."The starting position is up for grabs, and Ricketts will have a major say over that decision," Travis said."It's going to be a competition from the beginning."Travis said that Ricketts would have full reign over the goalkeepers. "I'm not going to tell DonovanRicketts how to coach goalkeepers," he said.Rising juniors Jake Deuel and Graham LaBran-Boyd and incoming freshmen Jonathan Whyte andTrevor Stormes will compete for the first-choice spot."If they're not motivated to be coached by some one as prestigious as Donovan Ricketts, then their passion for the game is not there," Travis said.Ricketts replaces Steward Ceus as Emory's goalkeeper coach. As an active player on the Haitiannational team, Ceus had to leave his post to fulfill his professional and national duties."With a little bit of luck, the stars aligned, and we were able to recruit Donovan Ricketts on to the coachingstaff," Travis said. "It's one of the best recruits that we could have had to help our program's prestige."Ricketts' decision to join a Division-III program stems from an overall mantra of working his way up. His ultimate goal is to cultivate some of the traits — such as fortitude and compartmentalization — thatsuccessful goalkeepers must learn to nurture, while also learning as much about coaching in theprocess."My ultimate goal is to grow in my new position as a goalkeeper coach and impart as much as I can on the goalkeepers [at Emory] to help them grow and develop into good and competent goalies," Rickettssaid.
