However, the one important procedure that took place was a vote to determine who would replace outgoing Speaker of the Legislature and Goizueta Business School senior Luke Bucshon.McBrown and SGA Sophomore Representative and College sophomore Cameron Duncan were the only members of SGA who ran for the position, and they both gave brief speeches explaining their credentials and advertising what they would do if they were elected.Duncan emphasized the importance of improving the attendance at SGA meetings, and he said that he would make this a priority by focusing ontransparency and accountability.McBrown, meanwhile, highlighted her passion for the community and her experience as a legislator.Both candidates then left the room, and a brief debate took place during which SGA members discussed the merits of the respective candidates.Darby also gave a short description of what the job of Speaker entails.“The Speaker sits on both the Executive and the Legislature, so it’s a very unique role,” Darby said. “TheSpeaker works to assemble the agenda, control the flow of meetings and conduct them. They have to verify that legislation is writing correctly and little technicalities like that. It’s an important role.”After a short period of deliberation, the vote was held, and the majority of SGA members selectedMcBrown to be Speaker. Bucshon handed over his gavel to McBrown, and she then used it to adjourn the meeting.
