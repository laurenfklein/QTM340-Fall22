The men's soccer team topped Sewanee University (Tenn.) on the road Wednesday evening with a score of 1-0. It was the Eagles' second straight win, evening their record at 3-3-1.It was an odd game by any standard. The game's only goal was scored in the second minute of play,when Sewanee accidently knocked the ball into their own goal. Neither team converted any of their opportunities for the game's remaining 88 minutes.That's not to say there weren't scoring opportunities for both teams. The Eagles totaled nine shots,including four on goal. Junior midfielder Darion Morgan led Emory with a pair of shots, while seniorgoalkeeper Abe Hannigan had another strong game with five saves and a clean sheet. The Eagles'defense held Sewanee to just five shots on goal and six overall.The Eagles look to start a streak at Huntingdon College (Ala.) on Saturday afternoon. A win againstHuntingdon would give Emory a winning record for the first time since Sept. 5 â€” that would carry into thesubsequent, tough University Athletic Association (UAA) slate.
