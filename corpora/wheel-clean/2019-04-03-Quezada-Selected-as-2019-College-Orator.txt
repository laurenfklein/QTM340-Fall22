In the piece, she posed the question, "what do we do make of young immigrants like me who were brought to the country aschildren, long before we could consent to the act or reason about its consequences?"She said that immigration is a multifaceted issue and that President Donald J. Trump has blamed many of the country's issues on immigrants, yet noted that her views may not be universally shared."What I wrote about in the op-ed — these issues having to do with immigration, specifically DACA — aredifficult, and not everyone agrees with the stance I take or my background and that's okay," Quezadasaid.The post Quezada Selected as 2019 College Orator appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
