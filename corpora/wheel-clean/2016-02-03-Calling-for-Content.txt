Dear Readers,It is almost guaranteed you've read something in the Wheel's Opinion section that you disagree with. The point of this section, and all Opinion sections for that matter, is for people to share their opinions in athought-provoking and intellectual manner. Ideally, each piece published here will encourage opendiscussion and perhaps make readers feel compelled to respond in some way with their own thoughts,research and ideas.Each and every person that makes up our Emory community is a potential writer for the Wheel's Opinionsection. It is only through widespread community participation that we can achieve the platform of expression that our community deserves.A desire to be heard and a willingness to work to develop and articulate one's arguments in a journalisticframework based on research are the only requirements for this section.Let me be clear about one thing: I do not agree with all of the op-eds published here. That might seem obvious enough, but it is worth stating. My primary duty as the Opinion editor is to not let my personal views hinder or censor your right to free expression.If you passionately disagree with an op-ed published here, if you want to counter what you consider to besomebody's baseless opinion, then your best option is to navigate the very same channel that they did and write a Wheel op-ed in response. It will reach the most readers and, most importantly, make others who disagree aware that their opinion matters.You, as members of the Emory community and readers of the Wheel, have the tools at your disposal to shape the Opinion section of this newspaper. My goal is for us to work together so that we mayresponsibly represent our Emory community.Sincerely,Erik AlexanderOpinion Editor, The Emory Wheel
