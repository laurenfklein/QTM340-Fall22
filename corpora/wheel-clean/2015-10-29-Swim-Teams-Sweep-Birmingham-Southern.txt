"The past few practices have been pretty strenuous. We've been focusing on little details in practice, with turns and starts and stuff like that, so that's what we're focused on improving on for the next meet."For their performance against Birmingham-Southern, three Eagles were named University Athletic Association (UAA) Athletes of the Week: Baker, Kowalsky and Rosenstock.
