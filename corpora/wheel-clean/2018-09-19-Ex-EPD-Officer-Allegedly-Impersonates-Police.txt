Kirkland was carrying a gun when he approached the home and displayed a badge.Suspicious of Kirkland's demeanor, the resident called the police, who questioned Kirkland.Kirkland said that although he was previously employed by the De Kalb County Sheriff's Office, he now works for the State of Georgia and not for a law enforcement agency, according to the police report.Kirkland said he identified himself to the resident as a peace officer.The responding officers could not confirm if Kirkland was an employee, so they released him at thescene.
