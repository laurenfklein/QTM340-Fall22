Eliot’s Prufrock and Other Observations, a copy of poet Sylvia Plath’s Ariel as annotated by Anne Sexton and collections of the works of W. H. Auden,Gwendolyn Brooks, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg and William Carlos Williams, among others,according to the website.Richard Hofmann, an Emory Creative Writing Fellow in Poetry, explained in an email to the Wheel why he finds Duffy’s poems unique.“Duffy’s poetry stands out, I think, for its dramatic situations,” Hofmann wrote. “Even in her short poems,even in sly and funny poems, Duffy is able to create what feels like a fully realized emotional world.”College junior Ryan Sutherland said that reading Duffy’s poems was a different experience from hearing them read by Duffy.“[It was] so much different.” Sutherland said. “It was night and day, it was comedic and casual in a way that writing could not express.”— By Emily Lim, Staff Writer
