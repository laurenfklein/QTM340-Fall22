The Emory women's track and field team finished third with a total of 104 points in the University Athletic Association (UAA) Indoor Track and Field Championships this past week end (Feb. 24-25), while themen's team totaled 29 points to land in last place.In the competition, held at at the Veale Athletic Center at Case Western Reserve University (Ohio), the University of Chicago women's team took home first place while Washington University in St. Louis(Mo.) won the men's side.Head Coach John Curtin said the women's score of more than 100 points would have been enough to win the UAAs in some of the past years but that the men's team has never performed this poorly."[On the men's side], we're obviously very disappointed," Curtin said. "[After the meet], our guys, we gottogether, and we took a long look at each other and saw each other's faces and believe there's too much talent in that room. We should've done better."On Saturday, the women's team logged in a pair of All-UAA and third-place finishes. Junior Paris Wagnerrecorded a distance of 14.87m in the weight throw and freshman Rebekah Bondi finished with apersonal-best mark in the long jump with a distance of 5.35m.Senior captain Gabrielle Stravach seized a title on Sunday in the mile run.

"It's a really cool experience and I've got two more meets. Hopefully, I can bring [the time] down and get the record [itself]."Several Eagles just missed out on the podium. Sophomore Luis Torres placed fourth in the 5000m run with a time of 15:04.62. In the distance medley relay, sophomores Samuel Branson and Alex Rand,senior Robert Wilhelm III and Brown clocked in a time of 10:14.74.

"There's something to be proud of. We had a lot of younger guys trying to adjust to the conference meet. We all know we can do a little bit better going into the outdoor season soon."The impending outdoor season signals a transition period for much of the team. Individual runners on the team will have differing training regimens based on the meets they plan to run, according to Curtin."Some of the kids will be running at Tufts [University (Mass.)] in the indoors, [but] a lot of the kids areresting and recovering from UAAs," Curtin said. "We have one group going back to base work and building up fitness for the [outdoor events]."The Eagles will have several athletes competing in last-chance meets this week, Mar. 3-4, at Tufts University before the NCAA DIII Indoor Championships at the Birmingham Crossplex Mar. 9-10.
