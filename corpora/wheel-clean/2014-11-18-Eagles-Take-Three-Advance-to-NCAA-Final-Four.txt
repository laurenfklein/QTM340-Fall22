Playing three days in a row didn’t affect the team, however.“Luckily for our team, everyone on the court has been through a Regional Championship and to the FinalFour, so we know what it’s like to play three days back-to-back and how the schedule of regionals goes,”sophomore right side hitter Sarah Maher said. “That experience might even have been one of our advantages this weekend: the sense of confidence in knowing that we’ve done this before.”The match for the title, against host Washington University was a back-and-forth, exciting game that ended with a 3-2 victory (25-23, 19-25, 25-18, 25-27, 15-12).
