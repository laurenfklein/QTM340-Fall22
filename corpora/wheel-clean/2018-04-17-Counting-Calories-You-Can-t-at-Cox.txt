If you're an Emory student, you complain about the on-campus food options; it's an unmistakable part of college culture. But we have no idea what we're actually talking about because the state of nutritional information at Emory is dismal. Only four out of the nine restaurants at Cox Hall — Freshens, TwistedTaco, Chard House Grill and Dooley's BBQ pit — display caloric information about their meals. TheDUC-ling at least associates calorie amounts with its dishes, but publicizes nothing about respectiveserving sizes. Regardless of whether dining services are simply uninformed or uncaring, Emorystudents remain unprepared to make healthy decisions.Devin Bog (20C) is from Fremont, Calif.
