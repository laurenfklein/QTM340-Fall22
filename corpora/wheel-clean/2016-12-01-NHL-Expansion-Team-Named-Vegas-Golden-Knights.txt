On Tuesday, Nov. 22, the majority owner of the NHL's newest franchise, Bill Foley, announced that the Golden Knights is the first major professional sports team to call Las Vegas home.The Golden Knights logo is a sleek, modern design, featuring a gold and gray knight's helmet set in the center of black shield with a golden border. A V for Vegas is subtly worked into the structure of thehelmet.Vegas' logo lacks the classic look of some of the original NHL franchises such as the New York Rangers or Montreal Canadiens, but has a bold look that gives it a unique appeal. The logo reflects thepersona of the knight that Foley reveres."The knight protects the unprotected, the knight defends the realm, the knight never gives up, nevergives in, always advances and never retreats," Foley said Tuesday night during a press conference to reveal the team name.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman's decision to sanction the addition of a hockey team in Las Vegas has already come under a lot of criticism. For the past few years, Bettman has been seeking to add another team to the NHL.Bettman was always one to seek nontraditional markets. Since Bettman became the commissioner in1993, the NHL has expanded from 24 to 30 teams, all of which were located in the United States. He was the commissioner when the Quebec Nordiques moved to Colorado and the original Winnipeg Jetsmoved to Phoenix. Bettman has focused on moving teams into warm weather markets.Despite the decision to relocate the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg, Bettman has traditionally been considered unfriendly to Canadian markets. Although Canadian cities Hamilton and Quebec City were among the cities that were under consideration to be given a team, Bettman ultimately chose Las Vegas.Bettman's decision to spurn the hopeful Canadian cities and choose Las Vegas as the NHL's 31stfranchise became a topic of scrutiny. There was concern that a team in a warm weather market wherehockey is not as popular might fail to draw a loyal fan base. Furthermore, the Arizona Coyotes' lack of success has added suspicion as to whether a team in the American desert can be successful.Many details are still unknown about the Vegas Golden Knights franchise, such as who the players and the head coach will be.What is known is that Golden Knights will take part in their first season next year. They will play in the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Vegas also already has its own stadium on the Las VegasStrip, the T-Mobile Arena.Former Washington Capital s General Manager George McPhee will be Vegas' general manager. He will be responsible for acquiring players and taking part in the expansion draft in June that will help provide the basic structure for his team.BEFORE:The NHL has provided basic rules for the expansion draft.
