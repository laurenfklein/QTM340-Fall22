H its against the boards, pucks launched through the air, the excitement that comes with every blow of a goal horn â€” nothing quite beats the experience of watching a hockey game. For the past four months,hockey fanatics have been starving. The September 2016 World Cup of Hockey has not been nearly enough to satiate their appetites. Now, the time has come, and it cannot be more exciting. Oct. 12 marks the start of the 2016-2017 hockey season. This season offers an aura of uncertainty. The usual questions arise: Who will be the next break out player? Which team will take the leap from mediocrity tocontention? Will the Pittsburgh Penguins continue the success that made them the best team in the league last year, since the hire of Mike Sullivan half way through last season? Eight months of in tensehockey action await us and those questions, among others, will likely be answered.The off-season passed quietly, despite some notable trades. One of the most noteworthy transactionswas the trade by the Montreal Canadiens to exchange P.K. Subban for Shea Weber of the NashvillePredators. These are two of the league's premier defensemen. Subban brings an innate playmakingability unmatched by most defenders, while Weber threatens even the best goalies with the hardest slapshot in the NHL.Other notable off-season acquisitions include the New York Rangers trading Derick Brassard for formerOttawa Senator Mika Zibanejad; the Edmonton Oilers acquiring a veteran presence in Milan Lucic to play alongside the coveted Connor McDavid; the Oilers trading Taylor Hall for New Jersey defensemanAdam Larsson and the hotly pursued Hobey Baker winner from Harvard University (Mass.) JimmyVesey signing with the Rangers.Power Rankings1. Pittsburgh PenguinsLast year's record: 48-26-8Key players: Sidney Crosby (F), Kris Letang (D), Evgeni Malkin (F)Player to watch: Matt Murray (G)2.
