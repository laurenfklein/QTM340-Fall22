Palmer said there were no extreme circumstances in the SGA presidential race.In the contentious race for SGA president, Ma earned 880 votes (37.18 percent), Neibart earned 791votes (33.42 percent) and Mario Karras (17Ox, 19B) earned 696 votes (29.4 percent).

Two students alleged that Ma attempted to buy drinks for students in exchange forvotes, and another two students accused M a of trying to obtain votes by offering executive positions. Inresponse, Ma filed a challenge against Karras for colluding with the challengers and creating "fakestories" about him. The Board did not release a decision on its cases by publication time.Neibart has been criticized for his past comments against same-sex marriage. On March 31, Neibartadded to his previous statement disavowing the comments."If the Emory community cannot trust me to lead their Student Government Association because of my past statements, I understand," Neibart wrote. "However, I can ensure that I will do everything I can to make the LGBT+ community feel safe and supported if elected as your President … While I cannot take back what I wrote, I can promise the Emory community that I will work tirelessly to improve this campus if I become your President."Ma said it is hard to predict who will win the run-off."I think Elias is a strong candidate, and I will try my best," Ma said.More than 230 students signed an online petition, started by Angela Jiang (19C) on Friday, requesting that the Elections Board recall the undergraduate elections. "To ensure that we at least maintain our basic democratic rights in asking for fair, transparent elections, I am asking for the Emory ElectionsBoard to institute a recall for this entire election, or at least a pause in the current cycle to fully investigate the numerous (putting it lightly) allegations against many major candidates," the petition reads.The Elections Board also declared the College Council (CC) sophomore legislator ballot invalid because the name of a CC sophomore legislator candidate mistakenly appeared on the SGA sophomorerepresentative ballot, according to a March 30 email from Xu.
