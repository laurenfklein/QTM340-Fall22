Hong emphasized David Kim'srefusal to restrict his social interactions to those with a similar background."There is clearly a boundary between Korean-American students and international Korean students [atEmory], and David â€¦ blended really well between the two," Hong said.Because of this, David Kim was known by members of KUSA and Code Zero as a liaison betweenKorean-American students and Korean international students. According to Eun, in those organizationsDavid Kim created an atmosphere in which there was no one who felt left out during an event or in anorganization."[Both] of the organizations he worked with ended up having a family-like environment," Eun said. "Ibelieve that David had an integral role in making sure that happened."Though David Kim fostered an inclusive environment among his peers, he still made sure to take care of his family in Olympia."I went through my college applications recently, and David connected me with a lot of his friends," Helensaid. "I really want to emphasize how much he valued relationships and I think it just shows that he still thought of others before himself. He wanted me to feel less lonely."A vigil was held in David's memory at Cannon Chapel Monday, Oct. 24. More than 200 people attended."I think he was loved by so many people, and that's why there were so many people at the vigil[Monday]," Hong said. "He was a very responsible, dedicated, hardworking, amicable and charismatic being who everybody loved."David is survived by his parents, Greg Seokwon Kim and Sunna Lee, and his sister, Helen Kim.
