Dear Doolina,Why’s your name Doolina?Sincerely,Wants to KnowDear Wants to Know,Well, aren’t you a curious little human? My name is Doolina because Dooley was taken, and I didn’t wanta man’s name, anyway. They say “real” women have curves, but skeletons don’t have any curves(except the sexy curve of my femur), and I was self-conscious about it. So I decided to own myfemininity and adapt Dooley to a more feminine interpretation. Hence: Doolina.Delightfully,DoolinaDear Doolina,There are four weeks of school left before I graduate (a semester early) and head off to start a full-timejob across the country. I’m excited to embark on the next stage of my life, but I’ve just started seeing a really great guy. We both know I’m leaving soon, and we know things will end then. My question is,should I end things sooner rather than later? Am I wasting my time with this guy, or is the time I enjoy spending with him not wasted time?Sincerely,Running out of Time Dear Running out of Time,Time you enjoy spending is not wasted time. That being said, you have five weeks left at the schoolyou’ve spent the last three years of your life at, and one at which you’ve presumably created a community of friends, mentors and family. You shouldn’t waste any time; you should try to squeeze every last ounce of enjoyment out of this place, this experience, before you leave. If you think you’ll do that by hanging out with a new beau, then by all means hang with the new beau. If you’d rather spend it going to brunch with that close friend from your freshman floor you used to stay up all night talking with,but never see anymore, then do that. These are your last weeks of college, supposedly the best time of your life. Don’t worry about wasting your time, worry about maximizing it. Good luck.Delightfully,Doolina
