TheTeaching Assistant (TA) for the course identified several internet sources that were copied fromverbatim. The professor and TA estimated that nearly one-third of the paper was plagiarized. The student admitted that he used the internet for background material for his paper, but as he did not start writing the paper until the night before it was due, he was rushed for time and did not cite or quote his sources. As the student had two prior violations, the Honor Council recommended an F in the course, a permanent mark on his personal record, and permanent dismissal from Emory University.The following reports are real cases adjudicated by the Emory College Honor Council.
