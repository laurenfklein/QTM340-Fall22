The Wheel received this letter from Arthur Doctor, Assistant Director at the Office of Sorority andFraternity Life, who said that it was written after a meeting held by Black Professionals within the Division of Campus Life. The list will continue to grow as it reaches more Black professionals.We, the Black Professionals of Emory University,In solidarity with Black students at Emory University, convened on November 19, 2015, to examine the consistent multidimensional inequalities Black students experience on campus and in society. As acollective, we value coalition building in movements and understand the exhaustive nature of forms of progress needed to dismantle the cycle of oppression for the Black community. We want you all to know that we see you; we hear you; we feel you. Beyond that, we seek to co-construct a plan of action to resolve structural and institutional flaws at Emory University.We, too, wear the mask. We have silenced our voices in moments where we could have cried out. We have adjusted our language and tone in an effort to be heard. We have stood idle when you needed our support out of fear of potential repercussions. We admire and are inspired by your courage, strength and boldness to evoke a much needed change.As employees of a university that strives for excellence, we must not be content with acceptance andtolerance. Understanding the importance of action-oriented care, we are committed to supporting you,organizing with you and fearlessly advocating for you.Yours in community,Courtney Jones-Stevens, Center for Community Engagement and LeadershipCourtnay Oddman, Residence LifeDes'mon Taylor, Residence LifeArthur E.
