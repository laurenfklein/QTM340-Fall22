" You just have to go out there and trust yourself to do whatyou've been practicing. Track and field is hard physically and mentally, so without the support ofteammates and coaches it wouldn't be possible."The men's team, ranked No. 4 in the NCAA Division III South/Southeast region, finished fourth with 64points and earned top finishes in a host of events. Senior Bennett Shaw finished the steeplechase with a time of 9:39.56, which placed him second to Jacob Hadden of Oglethorpe University (Ga.) who finished in a time of 9:24.33.

"Being able to bounce back and run fast times despite having run one or two other events that day is really important."The Eagles will return to action at the Tiger Track Classic at Auburn University (Ala.) on April 5 and 6.[caption id="attachment_32007" align="alignnone" width="1024"] Courtesy of PriyamMazumdar/Staff[/caption]The post Track & Field Stays Hot, Finish Top 5 in Classic appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
