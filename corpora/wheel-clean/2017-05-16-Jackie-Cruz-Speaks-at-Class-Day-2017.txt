I wanted to kill myself, but my mother said, 'Jackie you need to make it even more now. You have to inspire other people,' " she said in an interview with the Wheel before the event.Despite the serious content, Cruz kept her speech upbeat and entertaining.

It's doesn't matter what you look like. It's what inside thatcounts," Cruz said at Class Day.
