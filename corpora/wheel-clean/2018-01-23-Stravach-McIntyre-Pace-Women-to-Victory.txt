"This tournament might not be the best marker for how fit everyone is. I think we'll see faster times for both the long distance and short distance[runners]."Senior Erica Goldman and sophomore Kaitlyn Leonard led the Eagles in the 400m dash, finishing fourth with a time of 57.99 and sixth with a time of 58.51, respectively.In the distance medley relays, freshmen Talia Carlson and Lauren Rodriguez, junior Radhika Shah, andsophomore Ileana Zeissner took fourth place with a time of 12:57.22 while the other relay group,composed of freshman Ayla Kazemi, sophomore Nicole Steiner and juniors Kayla O'Shea and MaeveAndrews, finished in sixth place with a time of 13:01.70.Three key performers starred in the field events.

Though many runners returned home for the break, staying in shape remained a priority for the team. Some members of the team returned to campus early to train more."Early return [meant] our legs were little more tired [than usual]," Kattenburg said. "We put [in] a lot of volume over the last two weeks. I think getting back into a regular schedule and regular mileage [will]have us fresher and more ready."Both the women's and men's teams will return to the Birmingham Crossplex Jan. 28 to compete in the KMS Invitational.
