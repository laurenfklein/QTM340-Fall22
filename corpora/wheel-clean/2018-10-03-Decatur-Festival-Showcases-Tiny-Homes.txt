The third annual Tiny House Festival came to Decatur, Ga., for a dazzling display of architecture Sept.30. The festival was hosted by Tiny House Atlanta, an offshoot program of the Georgia-based nonprofitMicroLife. The program is "dedicated to building walkable, sustainable 'micro-hood' communities whileeducating individuals, groups and cities about the positive impacts of micro living," according to the TinyHouse Atlanta website.The festival, located on a sleepy street in downtown Decatur called Electric Avenue, not only showcaseda wide variety of tiny homes ranging from cabin to postmodern architecture, but also sponsoredpresentations from Tiny House speakers on the best ways to purchase, decorate and maintain their small homes.Living in tiny houses has in recent years become an increasing trend among those who are looking for simpler or more affordable living options. Builders at the festival explained that their homes were not onlymobile, capable of being transported on the highway, but also built to withstand the forces of a Category1 hurricane. Tiny homes, which range from 400 to 800 square feet, are built to the same health and safety standards as regular homes, meaning they must meet the rigorous and extensive criteria set by various national homeownership organizations.Most of these homes are large enough to house up to two residents and feature the standard components of a regular home. They usually feature a fully functional kitchen with an oven, stove andmicrowave, a bath room with a shower and toilet, and a bedroom fit for a queen-sized bed.Attendees were treated to a down-to-earth and family-oriented affair as they toured potential homes.They conversed with current Tiny House owners over warm meals purchased from vendors positionedthroughout the small festival. Emergency responders were present and emphasized safety, whilebuilders stressed comfort.But if the festival stressed one point above all else, it was that tiny homes are just as comfortable and habitable as normal-sized homes, or, as Tiny House Atlanta says, "More life, less space."The post Decatur Festival Showcases Tiny Homes appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
