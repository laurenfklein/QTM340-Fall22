Pa tients at for-profit kidney dialysis centers are less likely to receive kidney transplants than those atnonprofit centers, according to a Sept. 10 study published by researchers at Emory and health carecompany Kaiser Permanente.Dialysis is a medical treatment that substitutes the kidney's functions by removing excess water, saltand toxins and regulating other chemicals in the blood stream for patients with kidney failure. KaiserPermanente reported that dialysis is often more expensive, time consuming and dangerous than a kidney transplant.Though the study did not research the reason why patients at for-profit centers are less likely to receivetransplants, Director of the Transplant Health Services and Outcomes Research Program at Emory and the study's senior author Rachel Patzer offered the potential explanation that for-profit centers arefinancially motivated to keep their patients on dialysis."For-profit dialysis facilities make more profit when they have more patients on dialysis, meaning theydon't send them to get a transplant," Patzer said.The study examined publicly available national data from 2000 to 2016 on over one million patients withend-stage kidney disease. The researchers found that during that time, patients at for-profit centers were64 percent less likely to get on a waiting list or receive a kidney from a living or dead donor.Patzer hypothesized that this disparity could exist because for-profit centers engage in activities that may discourage their patients from getting transplants, such as providing fewer referrals fortransplantation. Patzer hopes to test her explanation in an upcoming study.She and her team have already collected data on referral rates in Georgia, North Carolina and SouthCarolina, and plan to expand their study to more states.Patzer recommended that lawmakers create financial motivation for centers to take their patients offdialysis."If we can incentivize dialysis facilities by rewarding them financially for patients that they are â€¦ sending to get evaluated for a transplant, that's a good thing for patients, and it could be a good thing for the healthsystem," Patzer said.The post Emory Study Examines For-Profit Dialysis Centers appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
