The greatest gift Emory gave me was an optimistic spirit. At Emory, every life path seems possible if you work hard enough for it. While I was here, I explored, I tinkered, I reveled in the curiosity Emoryimbued me with.College taught me that things are never as easy as they look and that choosing one door closes others.Oftentimes, I learned this the hard way — starting my own clothing company, Edward Foster, was much more difficult than I thought it would be.But the curiosity Emory provided me meant that I could always find new doors. I discovered genuinepassions inside the class room and out — working at the Wheel, learning how to hack in cybersecurityclass and understanding the historian's mindset.I discovered all kinds of incredible people, from my wonderful girl friend who lived on my hall freshmanyear to incredible professors who taught me new ways of thinking.I will never forget the warm embrace Beta Theta Pi gave to a lonely West Coaster who felt out of place so far from home. By joining a fraternity, I gained a family and a community that gave me somethingaccomplishments never could. I choose to remember and be strengthened by the wonderful experiences we had together, despite what happened to us.I could lament about how technocratic college has become and how the kind of community I found in Beta isn't as big of a priority as it should be, but this doesn't seem like the place for that.College was wonderful, and I only wish I could have had more of it. Take advantage of every opportunity while you can, and never stop dreaming.Duncan Cock Foster is a computer science major from Seattle, Wa.
