Varkey, assistant professor in Emory’s Department of Medicine and one of the five physicians to treat the first Ebola patients in the United States, was selected on April 6 to be the commencement speaker at Centenary College of Louisiana.Varkey, along with five of his peers in the Serious Communicable Disease Unit at the Emory UniversityHospital, aided in the successful treatment of all four Ebola patients at Emory between August and October of 2014.His experience treating the disease put him on Centenary’s radar after he was first suggested as a potential speaker by a mutual friend of his and Centenary President David Rowe, who graduated from Emory with a Master of Divinity in 1992.“One of the things that was really interesting to us is his very public back ground in treating Ebola […] but also his background at a liberal arts college,” Centenary Interim Senior Director of External RelationsKate Pedrotty said. Varkey earned his undergraduate degree from Marquette University, which does not have a graduate medical school.Centenary has an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 500 and advertises itself as the “oldestchartered liberal arts college west of the Mississippi River,” but Pedrotty said the college prides itself on the diverse interests of its undergraduates, particularly in the sciences. They aimed to find a blend of the two in Varkey.”We try to instill in our students an understanding of the world being bigger than their part of it,” she said.“We try to make connections for them between them and what’s going on in the world. The Ebola crisisbrings that into very sharp relief.”— By Ryan Smith
