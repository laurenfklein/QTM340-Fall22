In case you've missed the Career Center's steady stream of e mails or the non-BBA students roamingcampus in business professional attire, it's officially interview season. Like cuffing season, interviewseason is a time when students realize they might need some longer-term commitment in their lives â€”beyond a work-study position at the WoodPEC or an unpaid internship at a local magazine. Now is the time to embrace your impending adulthood and prepare to snag that dream job.What you wear is neither the only nor the most paramount part of the interview process, but how you present yourself throughout the hiring process is important. The ability to discern the difference between business formal, smart business and business casual and to execute the styles of dress appropriately when needed is valuable. If you're looking to take steps beyond borrowing slacks from a friend whenever you need to dress business professional, then investing in your own business attire can be a wisedecision. Plus, a new top or cute shoes can give you that extra spark of confidence.
