In his address to the room, hethanked Emory employees and reminisced on his time and legacy as University president.Wagner said his presidential tenure has been "a challenging time that was guided by moral principle â€”that gives us courage to take a risk, humility to admit mistakes, joy in the work, achievement and service in our mission, teaching and research and scholarship and health care and service and social action."When he described his motivations as president, Wagner quoted Emory alumnus and benefactor RobertWoodruff: "The future belongs to the discontented." Wagner added that he wished the community'sdiscontent, which he defined as the want for something better, to be remembered as "joyful, justifiablyproud and confident discontent" rather than "unhappy, disappointed, complaint-filled discontent."After representatives of the Employee Council recognized and thanked Wagner for his services, thepanel discussion began.Members of the audience questioned the panelists, who sat in the front of the room, on variousUniversity-wide policies, ranging from campus carry to maternity and paternity leave. Questions were submitted on line before the town hall and during the event itself. The questions were asked by employees and answered by panelists, one at a time, until the time allotted for questions ran out. In theirresponses, panelists explained University policies or initiatives or said that they would take employeeconcerns into consideration.One employee asked if Emory, like some other institutions, will be adopting policies that offer paidmaternal or paternal leave. When the panelists affirmed that the University will implement such policies in the near future, employees applauded. The panelists said that the specifics are being planned and will be completed at a later time.With regards to the installation of cameras in parking decks for the safety of employees, panelists said that cameras will be installed in new decks, but that these will take years to plan and build. The cameras will record video, but there will be no staff to monitor live video around-the-clock.Several employees asked questions regarding the construction of the new Emory Hospital building onClifton Road. Panelists responded by saying that staffing changes due to the new addition will not besignificant. They added that Clifton Road in front of the hospital may be renovated to accommodate structural changes.Other employees asked questions about the student climate on Emory's campus.One asked about the likelihood of guns being allowed on Emory's campus. The concern stemmed fromGeorgia's campus carry, which is a bill that will allow concealed weapons to be carried by licensed 21and-over individuals on public college campuses.Wagner replied that Emory will remain a "gun-free community."After receiving more questions about parking rates, Winship Cancer Institute and retirement policy,Jackson concluded the town hall. She recommended that employees use the Hot Topic Form on the Employee Council website to continue to ask questions and voice concerns. The Employee Council will then take those concerns and try to work them into policies, she said."Certainly [Employee Council] has grown," Wagner said. "I think this has been a time where [Emory has]become a better place to work. We have shown services that go beyond the bounds of our campus."
