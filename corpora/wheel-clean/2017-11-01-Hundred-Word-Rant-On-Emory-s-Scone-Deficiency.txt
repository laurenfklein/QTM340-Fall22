Now that it's fall, all I want to do is eat delicious, pumpkin-flavored baked goods. Kaldi's is one of the only places on campus to get those treats. But their pumpkin scones, which look so promising, are far fromappetizing. They are frequently so stale that they could replace the bricks being used to build the new hospital tower. A good scone shouldn't need icing, yet Kaldi's scones are covered in crusty, chaiflavored frosting; the word edible shouldn't be applied to these treats. To add insult to injury, bugs oftenswarm around the baked goods. Emory, is this the best you've got?Annie Cohen is a College sophomore from New Orleans.
