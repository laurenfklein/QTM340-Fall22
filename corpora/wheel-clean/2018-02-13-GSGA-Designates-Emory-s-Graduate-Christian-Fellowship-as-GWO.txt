The legislators also voted unanimously to fund Emory's Graduate ChristianFellowship the annual budget of $500.The Graduate Christian Fellowship is a graduate student community that seeks to "bless the University"through "practices of spiritual formation; integration of our faith, studies and work and proclamation of the good news about Jesus in word and deed," according to its Facebook.To be chartered as a GWO, an organization must show a "graduate-wide benefit" through its mission andpractices, include representation from more than half of the eight graduate divisional schools, ensure that"members from any one graduate division may not compromise equal to or greater than 50 percent of the membership of the GWO" and agree to an annual charter and monetary review, according to theGSGA chartering bylaws.Out of about 36 total members, the Graduate Christian Fellowship has roughly 20 members from LaneyGraduate School and 12 members from the Rollins School of Public Health, but also has members within the Goizueta Business School, Emory University School of Law and the Emory School ofMedicine.Graduate Christian Fellowship President Julian Hurtado (22G), Graduate Christian Fellowship TreasurerDanielle Winkler (19PH) and Faculty Adviser and Campus Minister Glenn Goldsmith represented the organization at the GSGA meeting.Hurtado sought to charter the organization as a GWO to to "ease initial recruitment in the beginning of theyear" and to "potentially ease [the process of] partnering with another organization," he wrote in a Feb. 13email to the Wheel.Hurtado emphasized the importance of connecting various Christian students across Emory's campus."The idea is to foster a community within the Christian organizations between all the different graduateschools," Hurtado said. "That's the vision."The organization will retain its GWO status for at least one year and is scheduled to undergo a standard review in Spring 2019.The $500 budget from GSGA will be used for a Spring semester outreach event and a Fall semesterwelcome dinner, Hurtado said.
