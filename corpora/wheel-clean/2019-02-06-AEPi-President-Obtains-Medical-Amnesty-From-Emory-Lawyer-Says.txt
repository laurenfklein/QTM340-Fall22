Yvette Jones, director of communications at the DeKalb County District Attorney's office, wrote in a Feb. 6 email to the Wheel, "We are still in the preliminary stages of evaluation and investigation and have not yet made a determination regarding a chargingdecision."Possession of cocaine is a felony in Georgia. Sharpe filed a motion to dismiss the case against him onJan. 28, according to court records.According to Georgia law, "Any person who in good faith seeks medical assistance for a person experiencing or believed to be experiencing a drug overdose shall not be arrested, charged, orprosecuted for a drug violation if the evidence for the arrest, charge, or prosecution of such drug violationresulted solely from seeking such medical assistance."EPD did not respond to multiple inquiries about whether Sharpe was seeking medical assistance and if he qualifies for medical immunity from prosecution.The post AEPi President Obtains Medical Amnesty From Emory, Lawyer Says appeared first on TheEmory Wheel.
