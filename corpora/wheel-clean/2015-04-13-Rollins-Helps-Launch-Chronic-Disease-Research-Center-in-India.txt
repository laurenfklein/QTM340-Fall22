S. Chowdary’s formal launch of the CCCC at its New Delhi headquarters within the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) on Tuesday, April 7. The center is a product of a partnership betweenRollins, the PHFI, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Donors of the CCCC include the National Institutes of Health, the London School of Hygiene and TropicalMedicine, the London-based Wellcome Trust and a variety of private donors, according to Curran, whoattended the New Delhi launch. PHFI President K. Srinath Reddy will preside over the nascent institution.The researchers studying these conditions, according to Curran, will publish their findings for the benefit of nations across the globe, not just India.Venkat Narayan, the Ruth and O.C. Hubert professor of global health and epidemiology and a professor of medicine at Rollins who also attended the launch, agreed.“Whatever can be done [at the center] in India can be applied to other places,” Narayan said.Narayan stressed the importance of addressing chronic disease in a country as large as India, whosepopulation topped 1.25 billion in 2013, according to the World Bank’s most recent data.“To think of chronic diseases, these are the leading causes of death in much of the world,” Narayan said.“India is very large, has a large population and has a huge share of these non-communicable diseases.”Rollins’ seven-year partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases, PHFI andAIIMS, which culminated in the creation of the CCCC over the past year and a half, will serve as a bridge for Indian and American students, according to Narayan.“People from India will come to the U.S. to be trained, people from Emory will go do research in India,” hesaid. “It’s become a really vibrant collaboration that we’ve developed over the past several years.”Rollins doctoral student Unjali Gujral, who will start a postdoctoral fellowship under Narayan in June and whose research focuses on the higher risk of diabetes among people of Asian-Indian descent, called the center “crucial,” as it gives researchers the opportunity to examine the lifestyle choices that lead to chronic conditions in individuals in India.“Chronic diseases are now global problems, and as such, there is a need for true global collaborations toaddress them,” Gujral, who has worked for PHFI in the past, wrote in an email to the Wheel.She added that she hopes to work at the center for part of her fellowship and throughout her career.— By Lydia O’Neal
