By early Saturday morning (Paris time), the Wheel confirmed that all 14 Emory students studying abroad in the city were safe.French President Francois Hollande labeled the attacks an act of terrorism by militant extremist groupISIS and declared a nation wide state of emergency, the New York Times reported. As of Nov. 14, the death toll has increased to 129 and the number wounded is now at 352.Administrators and faculty for Paris study abroad programs involving Emory students — the College'sSciences Po and EDUCO Paris programs, as well as the Goizueta Business School's programs —scrambled to confirm the students' safety via email, while a separate University notification system did the same for students registered with a travel advisory service available to Emory's students abroad.While all students from Georgia State University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Georgia and other Georgia schools who are studying in Paris are safe, the Atlanta Journal-Constitutionreported, one American student from the California State University at Long Beach was among the victims on Friday night, according to a CSULB press release.Around the start of the attacks at 10 p.m., Zhilin Zheng, an Emory College junior studying in Paris for theEDUCO program, returned to her home stay — west from the attacks that occurred in the 3rd , 10th and11th arrondissement."My house brother was with his friends at the house and ensured me that I was safe and to not worry,but I didn't feel in danger at all," Zheng said, adding that she immediately got in touch with her parents but was a bit delayed in announcing her safety on social media.Zheng, like other Emory students in the EDUCO program — which includes Emory, Duke, Cornell and Tulane University — received her first Emory notification from a Center for International ProgramsAboard (CIPA) administrator at 1:02 p.m. (Paris time) Meanwhile, Duke University students receivednotifications around 11:30 p.m., Cornell students around 12:30 a.m. and Tulane students at 1:38 a.m.,according to emails forwarded to the Wheel by students from the respective schools.While Emory parents received an email confirming that all Emory students in Paris were safe at 9:55a.m. Saturday, Emory students in Paris received a similar email about eight hours later Saturday. Dukestudents received a similar email, confirming the safety of its 25 EDUCO students in Paris about five hours before Emory, and Cornell received a similar message one hour after Emory. Tulane students in the EDUCO program did not receive an email confirming that the school's students in Paris were safe.College junior and EDUCO student Ahd Niazy, who was with several Duke students also studying in Paris as part of the EDUCO program, said she was "shocked" that Duke notified her friends and asked them to confirm that they were safe an hour and a half before any Emory source inquired about hersafety.Students registered with the travel advisory service International SOS, or ISOS, a service that Emorycontracts for its students abroad, received an Emory Office of Critical Event Preparedness andResponse (CEPAR) email requesting confirmation of their safety. On Saturday evening, all Emorystudents, regardless of whether they were registered with ISOS, received a CEPAR email urging them to register with the travel advisory service, register with a U.S. Department of State traveler safety service and continue to confirm their safety to family members back home. The CEPAR service has been used for several other recent crises abroad, notably the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, according toCEPAR Executive Director Alexander Isakov."When these events occur, Emory's Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response works with partners across the university to compile a comprehensive list of Emory travelers in the area of concern,ascertaining their well-being, and providing assistance as needed," Isakov wrote in a statement to theWheel. He added that, for the students not registered with ISOS, "CEPAR communicates with representatives across the university to help ensure that everyone is accounted for."Still, some students were surprised by the time disparity between alerts from their American universities.One Duke student who applied through Emory received her first emails from Duke just after 11:30 p.m.— but, like the Emory students in Paris, did not receive any emails from Emory requesting confirmation of her safety until 1:02 a.m.The CIPA administrator who notified EDUCO students prior to CEPAR wished not to be identified, as they were not authorized to speak to press during a crisis.Though seven perpetrators were killed Friday night, according to the New York Times, authorities are searching for an eighth perpetrator. The city remained quiet on Saturday and Sunday, save for the sound of frequent police and ambulance sirens, with schools, shops, libraries and museums closed and a heightened police and military presence in the streets. According to notifications from the ISOS service,a three-day mourning period has been declared and public gatherings are banned in the city until November 19.Correction (11/15 at 1:13 p.m.): Paragraphs ten, eleven and fourteen were up dated to include CEPAR'sresponse to the time disparities. The last paragraph was also updated. The article stated that eight perpetrators were killed, but seven were killed and authorities are searching for the eighth.
