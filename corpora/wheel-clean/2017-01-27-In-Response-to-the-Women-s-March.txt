Over the course of the past election, President Trump faced multiple sexual assault claims and maritalrape allegations. He was caught bragging about committing sexual assault and claiming that "all womenare bimbos." Trump's businesses were investigated for racial discrimination, and he made multiple racistremarks against Muslims and other minorities.This past Saturday over 147,000 protesters gathered for the Women's March in Washington; thousandsmore gathered at sister protests around the country and the world to oppose Trump's questionableattitude toward and treatment of women. The protest was one of the largest in American history, drawingfar more supporters than the inauguration of President Donald Trump the day before.The Women's March was not only a success for American women, but for women worldwide, 2as it showed that many Americans do not support Trump's stance on women's rights. It also communicated a strong message that President Trump's disrespectful attitude toward marginalized groups, personalliberties and freedom of speech is opposed by millions of Americans willing to fight for personal liberties and rights.News coverage of the march was generally positive, but backlash and criticism were quick to surface.The March was strongly criticized by New York Times columnist David Brooks for overemphasizingwomen's reproductive rights over less contentious issues. The critique of the march is not entirelywarranted, and misses a crucial point â€” women's reproductive rights are not only important for women,but society as a whole. Support for women's healthcare includes important issues besides abortion.Access to reproductive health care, birth control and education, for example, are causes that need support from women and politicians across party and religious lines.Despite these praises for the protest, the protest failed to be inclusive of the range of political and religious affiliations that surround abortion after the removal of a pro-life group from the Women's Marchofficial website's list of registered participants. The protest's "Unity Principles" championed "open accessto safe, legal, affordable abortion." It is imperative that women who believe in equality come together to fight for respect and personal freedom, regardless of their stance on abortion.The March's focus on reproductive rights also largely overshadowed the need to fight for the rights and fair treatment of all women, including transgender women and minorities.Though Trump carried 42 percent of the women's vote nationally this past election, the Women's Marchwas a strong rebuttal to Trump's offensive attitudes toward women displayed during the election. In the face of political upheaval around the world, this peaceful protest was a victory for conscious and activecitizenship.The March's ideals and successes should certainly be applauded, but if women aim to influence these important decisions, sustained action throughout Trump's presidency is necessary. The Women'sMarch should serve as a catalyst for continuous dialogue and as a call to action for all Americans. Afterwinning an election on a populist campaign, public support is Trump's strongest ally and his greatestliability. This march showed the world that millions of Americans do not support Donald Trump or hispolicies.The above editorial represents the majority opinion of the Wheel's Editorial Board.
