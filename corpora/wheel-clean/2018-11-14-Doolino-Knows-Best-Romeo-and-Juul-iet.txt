Dear The Frat and the Furious,I don't know which is the biggest crime you've committed: holding six college students for ransom orvaping in the library.You, my dear Frat and the Furious, are the poster child of toxic masculinity. You are 2 Frat, 2 Furious.Television shows like "How I Met Your Mother" might present gestures like stealing something for somebody you love as "romantic," but such an action is anything but; in reality, it's creepy and veryillegal.You project your own interests and experiences on to other people without, for a single second,considering other perspectives. Thinking you can play God, you take little actions that you observed from her and try to pull elaborate meaning out of it just to feed your unhealthy desires."I wish I got into this a capella group" does not equate to "please kidnap and torture this a capella groupso I can be a part of it," but your horrific savior complex seems to make you think otherwise.Read the signs without your ego obfuscating your view. She literally ran away at the sight of you and her roommate threatened to call the cops on you. Even after all of this, are you seriously so delusional to think that she would want to sleep in the same bed as you for an entire weekend?Perhaps even the worst people can change. I hope you will take my criticism to heart, probably while injail, given you just admitted to torture and abduction.Faithfully,DoolinoHey there Thanksgloomy,I heard the SGA president is hosting a Thanksgiving dinner. He seems like an interesting fellow. Whydon't you join him?You could also take this time to explore Atlanta or catch a deer sighting at Lullwater.Best of luck,DoolinoFor your day-to-day qualms and minor life crises, send anonymous questions todoolino.emory@gmail.com.The post Doolino Knows Best: Romeo and Juul-iet appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
