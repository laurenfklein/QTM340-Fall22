Be cause she possesses clear, tangible goals and experience as a member of the Student ProgrammingCouncil (SPC), the Wheel endorses College junior Genevieve Roth for SPC President.Beginning her work with SPC as a freshman representative, Roth, who is running unopposed, is familiar with its strengths and deficiencies, enabling her to be effective in improving the organization as a whole.Furthermore, her goals are achievable and are rooted in areas that she has seen a need for improvement in the SPC. Roth told us in her interview with the Wheel that she wants to “bridge the gap”between the various student bodies that make up the SPC’s constituency. The organization faces many unique difficulties because it is intended to represent all of Emory University, not just the College, and her focus on reaching out to graduate students and other schools is necessary for SPC’s mission. Roth also said she hopes to foster diversity in SPC, and if all groups are better represented,then SPC will be able to do its job more effectively.Her belief in greater delegation of duties in the SPC is encouraging because it could allow for a more efficient SPC that could better handle the needs of our community. Going hand-in-hand with her desire to get SPC members more involved through delegation, she also wants to push towards greatertransparency in both processes and in spending. This important move would allow students to engage more fully with SPC as a major body, especially as SPC’s budget is one of the largest in the University.While transparency may just be a buzzword, we hope Roth will be able to make serious moves to show how the organizations is spending its money.We have high hopes that Roth will make a special focus on improving both the relevance of SPC for those students who are not part of the College and on effective spending for major SPC events such asDooley’s Week, focusing on bring musicians and comedians that appeal to the wider Emory studentpopulation while avoiding unnecessary or inefficient purchases. ​We hope Roth will stay true to her platform and make strong strides for SPC in the next year.The above represents the majority opinion of the Endorsements Committee.
