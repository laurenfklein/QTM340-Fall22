"We made five birdies between 12 and 16, and Illinois Wesleyan made three doubles and a bogey. All of a sudden, we went from five down to five up."Junior Eric Yiu led the Eagles and spurred the comeback on the last day with a five-under-par 67.

"That's one of the better rounds I've seen in my 17 years."Preparation for the next tournament has already begun, Sjoberg said."We'll do some qualifying this weekend, a couple rounds," he said.
