Emory's Tam Institute for Jewish Studies partnered with the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival (AJFF) to hoston-campus film screenings and talk backs in White Hall from Sept. 15 to 17. The three-day festivalshowcased five films all grounded in Jewish themes, representing a wide range of genres that includedaction-adventure, documentary and even comedy. Through their selection of meaningful, engagingmovies, AJFF proved that film is more than just mere entertainment. Behind each film lies a heartfelt message that painted a better picture of the Jewish community and its history."Go for Zucker"The 2004 hit comedy film "Go for Zucker" kicked off the festival. Set in the early '90s, the German filmmeditates on sibling rivalry as Jaeckie Zucker (Henry Hübchen), a rambunctious daredevil andpersistent liar, quits his hustling career and abandons his Jewish roots after the destruction of the BerlinWall. Zucker soon learns of his mother's death and his subsequent inheritance; however, in order to collect this staggering sum, Zucker must come to terms with his distanced brother Samuel (Udo Samel),who happens to be an Orthodox Jew. Needless to say, the two share little in common.The sibling rivalry creates an engaging rollercoaster of emotions for viewers, and the film steadily rises toward its climax, which leaves the audience in constant suspense. Afterwards, audience members were treated to a post-film reception, which included German-style treats from Ali's Cookies."Monkey Business: The Adventures of Curious George's Creators"Children across the world have come to know and love the iconic Curious George; however, there is more behind the little brown monkey than meets the eye. The 2017 documentary "Monkey Business"follows the miraculous story of Hans and Margret Rey, Curious George's creators and German Jews forced to escape from the rising Nazi regime while protecting their artistic creation. Originally fromHamburg, Germany, the husband-wife authorial duo found themselves regularly on the move to places like Paris, Rio de Janeiro, New York and eventually New Hampshire.For many viewers, the film comes as a surprise, as it reveals the grim backstory behind the jovial ape.The documentary is beautifully crafted, with a Curious George-style animation portraying the Rey familystory. Prior to the film, former neighbor and Hans Rey protégé Nat Scrimshaw discussed his relationship with the couple and his former role as director of the Margret and H.A. Rey Center in New Hampshire.After the screening, Scrimshaw talked to moviegoers and even gifted on-the-spot Curious Georgedrawings to students. Hans and Margret's story shows audiences the art of perseverance, as their cartoon monkey has created a life for itself even after their passing."Bethlehem""Bethlehem" raked in one of AJFF's biggest audience turnouts, and it did not disappoint viewers. The filmfollows unpredictable Palestinian teen Sanfur (Shadi Mar'i) and his work with Shin Bet, a secret Israelisecurity organization. Sanfur is helping Shin Bet suppress his brother Ibrahim (Hisham Suliman), awanted suicide bomb director. "Bethlehem" was selected as Israel's official bid for Best ForeignLanguage Film Oscar in 2014.In his debut writing-producing role, Yuval Adler pulls from his experiences working for secret Israeliintelligence organizations to alternate between Israeli and Palestinian points of view. After its release,"Bethlehem" shocked critics and earned high praise, including 12 nominations at the Israeli AcademyAwards. The film went on to win for Best Editing, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director and Best Filmawards.With a perfect balance of story line and action sequences, "Bethlehem" reiterates that there are multiplesides to every conflict and that all are important to find a common solution. To drive home this point,Adler hired Ali Waked, a Palestinian reporter, to work alongside him as co-writer to show how individuals with two disparate ideals can collaborate harmoniously."Olympic Pride, American Prejudice"The festivities continued on Tuesday with "Olympic Pride, American Prejudice," a documentary whichreached viewers in both Germany and the United States. The 2016 film follows the 1936 SummerOlympic Games in Nazi Germany and the complicated racial conflict that resulted. Narrated by actorBlair Underwood, the film highlights the points of view of the participating athletes. At the time, the United States had to decide whether to participate in the games or to boycott them, while dealing with issues like the Great Depression and segregation on their own soil. Americans back at home were outraged when the U.S. decided to enter 18 African Americans and a number of Jews in the games. After much debate and astonishing athletic performances, the U.S. returned home as second place victors with an impressive total of 56 medals. This victory became a symbol of racial equality, a theme which the Nazisabhorred, and also paved the way for the coming civil rights movement.The film earned itself an Image Awards nomination for Outstanding Documentary. From the first clip, its serious tone confronts audiences. "Olympic Pride, American Prejudice" illuminates the similarities between the struggles of African Americans and Jews in the mid-20th century. The film included a Q&Aforum with its director Deborah Riley Draper, who is currently working on additional films aboutinequality."My First Wedding"To close AJFF on a cheerful note, Emory hosted a showing of "My First Wedding." The 2011 Argentinianfilm, which was nominated for four Argentine Academy Awards and directed by Ariel Winograd, detailsan out-of-control wedding between a secular Jew, Adrián Meier (Daniel Hendler), and a non-practicingCatholic, Leonora Campos (Natalia Oreiro). Shown through a series of flash back scenes, plans begin to go awry when Adrián loses the wedding rings. This mistake sets into motion a pattern of white lies and ridiculous antics in attempts to delay the wedding. The film's comedic effect comes from the conflict ofjuxtaposed figures such as arguing family members, crazy ex-partners and a debating priest-rabbi duo."My First Wedding" keeps audiences laughing and entertained as the conflict snowballs into utter chaos.The post Atlanta Jewish Film Festival Brings Jewish History to the Big Screen appeared first on TheEmory Wheel.
