The organization is a student-run kitchen that aims to keep food from going to waste, according to its website.Members of the organization at Emory collect leftover food from on-campus dining halls such as the Dobbs University Center (DUC) Market and Cox Hall, as well as the supermarket Earth Fare.Volunteers then re purpose this food into healthy meals and bring them to food pantries for those in need,Mainsel said.According to Maisel, the organization has come a long way since her freshman year, and she stated that she has an excellent team working with her to thank for that.Regarding the $25,000 award, Maisel said she plans to return to school in the near future to obtain amaster's degree in public health."[I want to use the money] towards helping me do good in the world," Maisel said. She wants to make all of her supporters proud, she added.After graduation, she is considering pursuing either a fellowship or research, but she said she might put off both options in order to travel the world.
