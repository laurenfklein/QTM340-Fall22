Courtesy of Emory UniversityEmory University Associate Professor of English and Creative Writing Jericho Brown was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for his work in poetry, according to an April 6 John Simon GuggenheimMemorial Foundation press release.Brown had submitted his two books of poetry, Please (2008) and The New Testament (2014), to the Committee of Selection of the Guggenheim Foundation for consideration. Brown said that he credits his two books for his ultimate receipt of the fellowship."It's gratifying," Brown said of his recognition in an interview with the Wheel. "[Yet] the reward is the workitself."The receipt of awards such as the Guggenheim Fellowship indicates that some one appreciates andrecognizes his work, Brown said, adding that a poet's work is oftentimes not immediately recognized,contrary to the experience of a performance artist, who may receive instant gratification when he or she performs on stage.With the funding from his fellowship, Brown plans to work on another book of poems, which he will titleCharacter, according to an April 6 Emory News Center release. Character will "focus on society'sobsession with celebrity and will be written in the voices of people from literature, the visual arts andfilm," the release stated.Funding amounts of the award vary for each individual recipient.The Board of Trustees of the Guggenheim Foundation awarded fellowships to 178 individuals this year.The Foundation announced the fellowship recipients Tuesday, April 5, according to its website.The Guggenheim Fellowship has been awarded annually since 1925 to those "who have already demonstrated exceptional capacity for productive scholarship or exceptional creative ability in the arts,"the website said.
