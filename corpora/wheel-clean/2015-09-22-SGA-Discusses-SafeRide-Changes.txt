These features are available only when SafeRide operates, from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.Zoberman also encouraged the use of SafeRide but brought up larger issues on campus, particularlyaddressing the issue of campus sexual assault. He suggested discussing infrastructural solutions tocampus safety. From a previous discussion with members of College Council (CC), Zoberman told the legislators that student protection is being evaluated to national standards and compared to equivalentinstitutions nationwide."We're working on improving communication between SGA and all the other divisions, and we're going to have a meeting with all different exec boards â€¦ in October," SGA President and College senior Raj Tilwasaid.Both Zoberman and Tilwa advocated reaching out and working with different groups to expand the capabilities of SGA.CC had many ideas brought up at their retreat this weekend, but they will have more to share andcollaborate next week, according to CC liaison and College junior Katerina Dvalishvili.Dvalishvili represented CC for this meeting instead of College junior and CC liaison Taj Singh. Both will serve as liaisons for College Council, but they will rotate their attendance at meetings.Minutes and notes from this meeting and those from SGA's retreat last week were unanimously passed.No bills were passed, but a Nomination Bill by Tilwa was introduced and placed in the weekly calendar to be addressed at the next meeting.
