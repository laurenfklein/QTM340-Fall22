The negotiation began slightly after that with The Chainsmokers' agency, Mayblum said, and was more prolonged because of the "hype"currently surrounding Khaled. He added that Khaled is a new client of United Talent Agency.Mayblum, co-Band Party Chair and College senior Julia Baker, SPC Advisor and Assistant Director of the Emory Integrity Project Rebecca Shetty and SPC President and College senior Genevieve Rothannounced on Thursday, March 24 to the rest of S PC that Khaled would perform. "Everyone wasjumping up and down," Mayblum said.As for the rest of the community, Mayblum said that, regardless of the circumstances, there will be those students who are "outspoken, happy [or] upset."He said that SPC's goal remains to ensure that every student finds programs and performances that they will enjoy over the course of this year's Dooley's Week.Correction (3/29 at 8:25 p.m.): Goizueta Business School senior Max Mayblum and College senior JuliaBaker were mistakenly listed as Dooley's Week co-chairs.
