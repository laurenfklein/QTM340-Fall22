An Emory security and fire report released Sept. 29 reveals a significant decrease in drug and liquor law violation disciplinary referrals in 2016.Emory released the 2017 Annual Security Report, Annual Fire Safety Report and Statement of CampusSecurity Policy through a University-wide email from Vice Provost of Equity and Inclusion Lynell Cadray.The data reflect the calendar year 2016 and historical data from 2015 and 2014 collected by Emory Police Department (EPD) and Campus Life.According to the report, drug law referrals decreased to 17 cases from 55 in 2015 and 85 in 2014. Liquorlaw referrals decreased to 148 from 294 in 2015 and 302 in 2014.Referrals are recorded when a member of Campus Life catches an individual with drugs or alcohol. If a student is caught by EPD and arrested or receives a citation, an arrest is recorded.There were 12 drug law arrests and one liquor law arrest in 2016.The Wheel emailed Assistant Vice President for Public Safety and Clery Act Compliance Officer CraigWatson to ask for a potential cause of the decrease. Watson, who is mentioned as the person of contact for inquires related to the report, forwarded the inquiry to Campus Life Director of Communications Senior Director for Communications Tomika DePriest, who did not respond by press time.Rapes increased to six from four in 2015. Both numbers represent decreases from the 25 reported rapesin 2014.Burglaries increased to 29 cases from 20 in 2015 and 20 in 2014.Motor vehicle thefts decreased to four from nine in 2015 and 14 in 2014.Emory released the report in compliance with the Clery Act, which requires colleges to disclose crimestatistics in an annual report, even if the crimes are reported anonymously or determined to beunfounded.Cadray told the Wheel last year that not all crimes are reported and included in the report."We'd like to attribute it to all the great work we're doing, but we can't underestimate the lack of reporting that exists on campus," Cadray said. "It's very intimidating for any student to even think about reporting,but we're trying to make sure that we're developing processes that make students feel comfortable doingso."
