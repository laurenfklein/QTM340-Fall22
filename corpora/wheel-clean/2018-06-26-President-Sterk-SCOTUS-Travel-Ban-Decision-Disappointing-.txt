University President Claire E. Sterk released a Tuesday statement expressing disappointment in the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to uphold President Donald Trump's travel ban and vowed to "ensure thatEmory's doors remain open to bright, dedicated thinkers from all nations, faiths and backgrounds."Trump's travel ban restricts immigration from several Muslim-majority countries, citing national security.Chief Justice John Roberts, who authored the majority opinion upholding the ban, said that the ban is"squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.""Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the executive order on immigration is deeplydisappointing," Sterk wrote.Emory employs more than 2,000 full-time instructional staff members, of whom 5 percent arenonresident aliens, according to an amicus brief filed jointly by the University and 30 other colleges.About 320 of Emory's 944 full-time research staff members are nonresident aliens.Though Emory presidents have rarely commented on Supreme Court decisions in the past, Sterk'sstatement is one of many signals by the University administration demonstrating opposition to the travelban. Last year, Emory filed three amici briefs and signed a letter against the ban with 30 otheruniversities."We will continue working closely with our university colleagues and our community and governmentalpartners to ensure that Emory's doors remain open to bright, dedicated thinkers from all nations, faithsand backgrounds," Sterk said.Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote blistering dissents, stating, "a reasonableobserver would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus."
