The plan comes after the widespread outbreak of Ebola in mid-2014 in Sierra Leone,Liberia and Guinea.“We are providing capacity so that the African people can be much more prepared in the future than they were in the past” -McNabb“If a pandemic like this swept through Georgia, you could imagine the chaos and disruption of normal health services, and that is what is happening right now,” McNabb said. “Our intention is to come to WestAfrica, now that we are starting to contain this disease, and help rebuild.”McNabb and his team are one part of Emory’s multi-faceted response to Ebola. Earlier this month,Emory hosted a conference and held a panel to provide platforms for the ongoing Ebola discussion. Infall 2014, Emory University Hospital served as a treatment facility for four Ebola patients.“As the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has shown, improving health security in countries around the world is of utmost importance,” wrote CDC Health Communications Specialist Justin Williams in an email to the Wheel. “Until countries have the ability to prevent, detect and respond to infectious diseasethreats, all countries are at risk.”Unlike most financial partnerships, this initiative’s goal is to improve the public health capacity of Africa,not of Emory, according to McNabb. Of the $7.43 million, 45 percent is going directly to Africa.McNabb and his team were one of six awardees. Emory was approved for funding based on their rank score from an objective review panel, according to CDC Extramural Affairs Specialist Herbert Kimble.One major goal for the African Centre is to build a strong work force that can respond to public healththreats. According to McNabb, the affected West African countries lacked the organization to provide adequate health systems and trained personnel, creating the outbreak last year.The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.Some of the public health issues of global concern in West Africa include emergence and re-emergenceof pathogens, development of drug resistance and accidental laboratory pathogens, McNabb explained.By 2013, more than 100 World Health Organization (WHO) members had not met the WHO’sInternational Health Regulations (IHR) requirements regarding public health concerns. The AfricanCentre’s goal is to help African countries meet these requirements by “providing in-country training for public health professionals in the areas of surveillance, epidemiology, laboratory, communications,infectious disease and preparedness,” McNabb said.According to McNabb, he is hopeful that the center will be a landmark institution, influencing Africanpolicy and public health.The first two years of the five-year program are focused on working with local partners across Africa to meet their training needs while the last three years of the project will be devoted to establishing the African Center — a facility that will sustain the training needs for public health professionals in WestAfrica.The program aims to provide urgent training to public health officials in systems including e-surveillance,a technique that uses technology such as mobile phones to provide public health data. This will digitizeAfrican analog health systems.According to McNabb, the project will also include training in communications, epidemiology, outbreakinvestigations and data analysis.“This will allow health workers to better understand the situation, which is a key piece of the program,”McNabb said.The partners include Rollins School of Public Health, the African Field Epidemiology Network, the International Association of National Public Health Institutes, Emory’s Institute for Developing Nations and the African Society for Laboratory Medicine.“Going forward, this puts us at the forefront of a very hot topic and allows us as a University and as a school to build on what is already a growing reputation from our treatment of the Ebola patients,” ChrisHoover, a student in the Rollins School of Public Health, wrote in an email to the Wheel.
