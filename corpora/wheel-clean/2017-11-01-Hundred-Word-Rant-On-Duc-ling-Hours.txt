The DUC'ling serves breakfast from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and then promptly begins preparation for 11 a.m.lunch. What is a poor freshman with limited funds going to do if she has class during those hours?Perhaps 24-hour service is an unrealistic expectation, but 10:20 a.m. is a reasonable time to want food.Students should at least have access to the salad bar, which is ready long before 11 a.m. but heavily guarded by staff to prevent pre-lunch snacking. As the primary dining hall for students who rely on mealswipes, the DUC'ling's hours need to be more comprehensive.Janvi Pamnani is a College freshman from Syosset, N.Y.
