The Emory golf team concluded its fall play earlier this week on Monday and Tuesday at the Chick- fil-ACollegiate Invitational, hosted by Berry College (Ga.).The 18-hole tournament consisted of two rounds, and the Eagles fin- ished sixth out of the 21 teams in the competition.The Eagles now look to build upon their impressive play as they move into the spring season.The weather was near per- fect, allowing for a great fall sea- son finale. Additionally, the 72-par course,located at the Coosa Country Club in Rome, Ga., was in excellent condition.“Most of the holes were straight- forward,” Assistant Coach Jonathan Chen said. “This was a much better finish than any the other events of the fall. We may have struggled down the stretch on Tuesday,but we pulled through to get a sixth place finish.” The team performed outstanding- ly on Monday, residing in the fourth place spot by the end of day.Leading the team was senior Alex Wunderlich, who shot an incredible score of 70.To put this score into perspective, Wunderlich shot a 77 in the second round and still finished with the16th best score at the invitational.Tying in second for the team’s lowest scores on Monday were sophomore Sam Nichamin and junior Jonathan Gerrard, each of whom shot an impressive 74.On Tuesday, the Eagles dropped two spots to finish in sixth place overall.“We played well on Monday for sure, and had three real good rounds,” Head Coach John Sjoberg said.“We played okay on Tuesday, but didn’t drive the ball as well as we did on Monday. We have a lot of work to do, but our results show that we will hopefully continue to improve moving forward.”Leading the team with a score of 74 on Tuesday was junior Jack Williams. Williams was actually the only player on the team to improve his score, shooting six shots better than he had on Monday. The second best score on Tuesday belonged to Nichamin, who shot a 75.When asked about his perfor- mance at the tournament, Nichamin had mixed feelings.“I felt that I should have posted a much better score in round one, but I was playing pretty poorly the second day and was happy that I was able to put together a solid final nine and break par on the last side of the fall,” Nichamin said. “I did a lot of things well and I think the mistakes that I made are easily correctable, so I’m just excited to get to fixing those things over the off season and come out strong in the spring.”The Eagles will now have a long off season to improve their game, returning to action Feb. 28 at the Callaway Gardens Invitational in Pine Mountain, Ga..— By Michael Scheck, Staff Writer
