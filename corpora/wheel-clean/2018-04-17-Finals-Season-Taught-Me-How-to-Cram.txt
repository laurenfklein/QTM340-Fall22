With the end of the semester rapidly approaching, remaining assignments keep us from preparing for our final exams. Two days of preparation immediately before finals are simply insufficient. Most Emorystudents take four to five classes per semester; two days to study for exams worth so much of our overall grades is not enough. Instead, Emory should follow the example of many other institutions, like Harvard University (Mass.) and the University of California, Berkeley, and offer a week without classes to give students adequate time to prepare for exams. Though we would have to leave school later, the current policy reinforces sleep deprivation and unhealthy habits like cramming, which hinders our information retention. This directly contradicts Emory's motto of lifelong learning.Madison Stephens (21C) is from Little Rock, Ark.
