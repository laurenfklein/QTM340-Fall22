The English as a Second Language (ESL) program changed its name to the English Language LearningProgram (ELLP) and merged its tutoring program with the Emory Writing Center this semester,according to Senior Associate Dean for the Office of Undergraduate Education Joanne Brzinski.Brzinski said the change should allow ELLP and the Writing Center to streamline the tutor trainingprocess and better offer writing support for non-native English speakers."One of the things that we learned over time is that there was significant overlap between the work theESL tutors did and the [work the] Writing Center's tutors did," Brzinski said. "[With this change,] all of the tutors have the training that we think they need, and we are able to more flexibly work with students'writing."ELLP Director Jane O'Connor said the new department will clarify the process to access learningresources to students, who previously had to choose between two ways to sign up for writingassistance.Former ESL tutors were integrated into the Writing Center staff as English Language Learner specialists,according to Associate Director for English Language Learning in the Writing Center Levin Arnsperger.O'Connor said the program changed its name from E SL to ELLP to reflect its scope of work. Aside from supporting international students, the program also provides mentorship for graduate students who work with non-native English speakers and students studying English-teaching methodologies. O'Connor is currently working to optimize support for such graduate students.ELLP also advises faculty members on how best to work with students who began learning English later in life."This is something that has not developed as much as we want, but the changes we've made gave us the possibility of actually developing some of those resources for faculty," Brzinski said.While ELLP tutoring has thus far focused on writing skills, Brzinski said the program directors are interested in expanding the program to also help students with listening and communicating skills."This semester, for the first time, we developed the class called Academic Communication Skills, ENG124 â€¦ to develop [non-English speaking students'] reading skills, listening skills and presentation skills,"O'Connor said. She added that the ELLP hopes to develop support for faculty and graduate students who work with students whose first name is not English.The post ESL Tutoring Program Rebrands, Merges With Writing Center appeared first on The EmoryWheel.
