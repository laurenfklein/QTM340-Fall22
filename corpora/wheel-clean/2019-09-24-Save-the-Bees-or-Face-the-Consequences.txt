Honey bees are vital to the environment, to the U.S. economy and to our health. They serve as a keystone species for their habitats and pollinate more than 80 percent of cultivated crops for an economic impact of more than $20 billion. They also provide nutrients to our diets. But honey bees aredying, and we must adapt our lifestyles to save them. Colony collapse disorder is rampant, andpesticides are responsible for most of the recent decline in honey bee populations. Pesticides demolishbees' motor-function and memory. If you are vegan, and it does not conflict with your religious beliefs, Iencourage you to consider consuming honey to sustain the beekeeping industry. If you already buyhoney, purchase it from local farmers. Everyone should research donating to bee sanctuaries or investing in an apiary. We all must use non-chemical pesticide alternatives to revive the species'population count.
