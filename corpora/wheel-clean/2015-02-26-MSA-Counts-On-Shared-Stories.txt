Each day of the month ofFebruary, a Muslim student or alumnus of the Emory community has been featured on the MSAFacebook page, as well as on a daily blog where they post about their religious identity.The goal of the stories that the students and alumnus tell is to express the diversity of experiences within the Muslim community at Emory and exemplify how these richly varied stories bring together a group ofindividuals, each of whom contribute to the multitude of perspectives on campus.Formative stories — those that featured — shared throughout this month include College freshmanSundus Tameez’s story of wearing the hijab and how, during high school, wearing this garment helped her to dispel many stereotypes held by her peers and teachers regarding Islam.Post by Emory Muslim Students Association.Third-year Emory Law student, Ahmad El-Gendi, wrote about how he views his fellow worshippers as apart of his extended family.

Instead of just focusing on what Islam is,it focuses on how Islam plays an integral part in people’s lives,” Shaheen said. “It hones in on a common teaching that Islam is more than a religion — it is a way of life and the blog really epitomizes that.”- By Lokita Rajan, Contributing Writer
