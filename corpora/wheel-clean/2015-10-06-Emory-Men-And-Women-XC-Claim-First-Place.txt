Under the ominous, drizzling clouds in Oxford, Ala. this past Saturday, the Emory men's and women'scross country teams competed in the Jacksonville State University Foothills Invitational at the Oxford Lake and Recreation Center. Both the men's and women's teams dominated, placing first in their respective races. The results push both squads into the NCAA Southeast Region No. 1 spots."We were a little worried about the weather but we were actually pretty fortunate," Head Coach JohnCurtin said. "The rain was light in Oxford all morning and the course held up very well."The women's team dominated the 5K, posting the top-five overall scorers and blowing away the competition with best-possible 15 points; runner-up Birmingham-Southern College (Ala.) finished with 72points.

Meanwhile, sophomore Gabrielle Stravach (18:38), senior Aileen Rivell(18:42), sophomore Megan Waples (18:45) and freshman Clare Ubersax (18:47) rounded out Emory'sscoring."It was the best team effort by far for the women," Curtin said. "We had six girls break 19:00 and we have never had more than three do that in previous years."Outside of the obvious dominance of Viox, Curtin was especially impressed by the performance ofUbersax, who he said beat her personal record by over a minute."Clare Ubersax broke into our top five scorers for the first time," he said. "Honestly, I wasn't surprised by her performance. That kid is just scratching the surface of her ability."The men's team led the 8K race's five-team field with 16 points, 30 better than runner-up BirminghamSouthern (Ala.).Spring Hill College (Ala.), Tuskegee University (Ala.) and Miles College (Ala.) followed inthird, fourth and fifth, respectively.
