Emory is partnering with Atlanta's PATH Foundation to construct two new bicycle-pedestrian trailsconnecting the University's main campus with the PATH foundation's existing network of trails acrossAtlanta, according to a Jan. 10 University press release.The new trails, which are expected to be operational by August 2019, will begin at Andrews Circle andcross Haygood Drive. One route will follow Haygood Drive to cross Clifton Road at the Woodruff HealthSciences Center Administration Building and continue on to Means Drive toward the new Student LifeCenter and end at the Woodruff Physical Education Center. The other route will follow North DecaturRoad across from Druid Hills High School and finish at Clifton Road and the School of Law.Construction is set to begin in May 2019, according to David Payne, associate vice president of planning and engagement for the Office of the Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration. However,the trail system is expected to be fully completed by 2020, according to the press release.Currently, the PATH Foundation's South Peachtree Creek Trail connects Clairmont campus withMedlock Park, Mason Mill Park and near by neighborhoods.Emory will oversee construction inside campus, while the PATH foundation will conduct constructionoutside the University, according to Vice President for Campus Services Matthew Early.Early said increased access to campus will benefit commuters."It will allow folks to use other modes of transportation — whether it's walking, bicycling or scooter — to have access to our campus without getting into a roadway," Early said.Director of Sustainability Initiatives Ciannat Howett said the trails will help link students living on the Clairmont campus with main campus."They feel separated from the core of campus … because they are physically separated," Howett said. "Ithink it's going to be fantastic to have this very safe way for students to get from the Clairmont campusinto the heart of campus right next to the new Student Life Center."Howett also noted that new trails will connect Emory with the greater Atlanta area."PATH has a really robust trail system that goes all throughout metro Atlanta and Georgia," Howett said."It's going to draw people to want to come to Emory and enable Emory community members to connect more outside our gates."The trails will also help Emory meet sustainability goals, according to Howett. The trails will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, which comprise the second-largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions at Emory."We also have goals to improve air quality in our local campus area," Howett said. "A lot of that is getting cars off the road."Brian Fleischer (20B) said students living at Clairmont campus believe the new trails will act as a safer,more desirable way to travel to campus."I love using Lime or Bird to travel between the campuses but feel unsafe using them on sidewalks or in the road," Fleischer said. "I think a path between these two areas would really encourage students to spend more time at main campus."Proposed PATH Trails at Emory by on ScribdThe post Two New PATH Trails to Run Through Emory appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
