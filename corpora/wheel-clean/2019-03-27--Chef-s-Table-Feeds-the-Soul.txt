Volume 6 of Netflix food documentary series "Chef's Table" turns food porn into a meditative exercisethrough brilliant cinematography and a faultless score. Each episode explores myriad aspects of the featured chef's life and identity, creating a strong, emotional attachment between the viewer and the chef.Unlike past seasons, Volume 6 veers away from the somewhat distant lives of glitzy Michelin-starredchefs like Massimo Bottura and Ana Ros. Instead, it focuses on the complex lives of four up-and-comingchefs and how food has shaped their identities.Contrasting the increasingly commercialized cooking entertainment industry, Volume 6 swerves in the opposite direction from the toxic competition of "MasterChef" and the ubiquity of easy Tasty recipes onsocial media. Whereas shows like "MasterChef" put participants in intentionally difficult situations in order to cultivate drama, "Chef's Table" presents raw, slow-burn narratives from each chef, accompanied by stunning panoramas of cities and countrysides. All the tension comes from the chefs' personal lives,rather than from the staged drama of a competitive cooking show. Motifs or ingredients central to certain dishes are introduced early on and referenced throughout the course of each episode. This culminates in a cathartic visual portfolio of a chef's repertoire, transcending the standard of Tasty videos by helpingviewers appreciate food and cooking as more than just a means to a full stomach. The episodic structure and added emphasis on personal over culinary identity have become central to the intimate biographies of "Chef's Table."
