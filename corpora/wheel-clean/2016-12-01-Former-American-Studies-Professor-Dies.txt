Elliott remembers him as having a tremendous impact on campus."[White] was a remarkable scholar of the history of cities, particularly Atlanta, and he was a mentor togenerations of students and faculty," Elliott wrote in a statement to the Wheel. "I think that everyone who knew him felt a deep sense of connection. His profound intelligence was joined to a sense of warmth,and so his intellectual excitement was contagious."Rosemary Magee, Rose Library director and a former Ph.D. student of White, remembers his dedication throughout his career to uniting students from different backgrounds."In no time, he began to be known as some one who brought people together from surroundinguniversities such as Georgia Tech, Morehouse and Spelman to Emory and vice versa," Magee said.Those who worked with White remembered his knack for teaching through storytelling.Crimmins, who co-instructed urban history classes at GSU with White, said that his colleague was "awonderful storyteller." The two collaborated on several initiatives including "The Problem of the ColorLine" project, a workshop series that educates Atlanta K-12 teachers about the city's civil rights history."[White] used stories with humor to make points," Crimmins said. "He was just a delightful colleague to work with."Goodrich C. White Professor of Film and Media Studies Matthew Bernstein, who co-taught with White"Baseball in America" in the American Studies department, noted White's dedication to his students."He was interested in his students personally and he was always very sympathetic [to them] â€¦ he delighted in students who took the material and ran with it," Bernstein said. "I remember him as someone who is imbued with the joy of living, a joy of being part of a community devoted to learning."Curator of Modern Political and Historical Collections at the Rose Library Randy Gue, a former graduate student in Emory's Film and Media Studies Department, echoed that White left an impact on Emory and its students."White gave me my life's calling," Gue said. "Studying Atlanta is my passion. It is what I love to do.Without Dana White, I would've never found that."White's papers, journals and audiovisual material are housed at the Rose Library.
