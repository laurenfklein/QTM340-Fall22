The 50th legislature of the Student Government Association (SGA) convened March 27 for its last legislative session to discuss three bills on chartering and the SGA budget following the University-widereferendum that split Student Government into two autonomous branches.All three bills passed unanimously with 13 votes.SGA Vice President of Finance Jason Yu (17B) presented Bill 50sl32 and called for approval of the SGAAdministrative Budget for the 51st Student Legislature. The SGA Administrative Budget "providesadministrative funding to the SGA Executive Board for running the SGA itself and SGA programs orevents," according to SGA's Finance Code.The proposed $27,458.80 administrative budget is 24 percent lower than the 50th legislature'sadministrative budget, which stood at $36,130. The budget reflected a reduction across all spendingcategories to account for the loss of graduate funding."The administrative account of SGA is directly [affected] funded by the fee split," Yu said. "This bill shows the legislature how we intend to spend the money."Yu also presented a financial report of undergraduate divisional councils funded in Fall 2016. CollegeCouncil spent $247,759.60, BBA Council spent $29,878.96 and Emory Student Nurses Association(ESNA) Council spent $27,050.48. Under the University-wide Organization (UWO) umbrella, Club Sportsspent $77,870.86, Media Council spent $69,345.76, Outdoor Emory spent $23,894.39 and Table Talk spent $2,550.13.SGA ultimately approves both divisional council and UWO budgets, but divisional council budgets aren'tsubject to as strict of a review process, Yu said."We wouldn't be questioning the rationale behind [divisional councils'] allocation decisions, but rather just ensuring that they are following the proper guide lines for the use of Student Activity Fee money," Yu said."UWOs are essentially clubs chartered within SGA, and thus we would be examining their budgets and asking them to provide more information about why a club needs a certain amount of funding for anevent."Divisional councils use their allocated funds at their own discretion, and spending is "pretty standard year to year," Yu added.Bill 50sl31, also presented by Yu, called for the temporary suspension of two sections of the SGAFinance Code to avoid breaching its laws: Part V, Clause 21.3.1, which states "All deadlines and the Operational Budgeting Process must be before the SGA elections" and Part IV, Clause 19.1 of the SGAFinance Code, which states that any changes to the SGA Fee split must be made at least 30 days before the date on which operational budget requests are due.According to Yu, SGA is unable to fulfill those requirements in wake of the government split. UWOs areunsure of the amount of funds they will be receiving from the graduate divisions as the SGA and Graduate Student Government Association (GSGA) undergo negotiations, leaving it impossible for SGAto complete a budget on time. Additionally, the General Finance Timeline, and Part IV, Clause 19.1needed to be suspended to account for fee splits that will take place next month under the new government structure, Yu said.Bill 50sl30 called for the creation of an "Executive Agency" designation and charter to replace the"University Wide Organization (UWO)" designation outlined in Article 3 of the SGA Chartering Bylaws,and was submitted by SGA Attorney General Christopher Lam (17B). The bill proposed theterminological change as SGA and GSGA now share control of UWOs under the Joint GovernanceCommittee (JGC), which has yet to create a contemporary definition of the term.According to the bill, an executive agency "must demonstrate to the Legislature that it is logisticallyunfeasible for the organization to carry out their mission under an undergraduate divisional council," and is subject to yearly review by the SGA."Once [the executive agencies] are set up, standards will be decided which will be unique to theorganizations," Lam said. "[Student Programming Council] (SPC) might be evaluated based on how many people show up to their events and Table Talk might be evaluated on how many different divisional councils they are able to cater to."The bill acknowledged that Table Talk and SPC both "primarily serve under graduate students," andgranted the organizations their Executive Agency Charters. The new charters replaced their classification as UWOs and puts them under the governance of the SGA, although future organizationsseeking the Executive Agency label will be subject to majority approval from all undergraduate divisionalcouncils in addition to the SGA legislature."To speed up the process since [SPC and Table Talk have] shown they've been capable of catering tomultiple divisions, we are for going the process of having the four undergraduate divisional councils[vote]," Lam said.The legislature also unanimously approved a charter of The Emory Poker Club after finding that they met all requirements under the SGA chartering bylaws, including acquiring a minimum number of 10members.
