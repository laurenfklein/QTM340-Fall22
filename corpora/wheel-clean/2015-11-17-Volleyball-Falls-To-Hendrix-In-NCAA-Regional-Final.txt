Junior setter Sarah Maher put up 10 kills and 11 digsfor her 11th double-double (double-digit kills and digs) on the year.The spotlight of the game, however, was on senior setter Sydney Miles, who, became the Emorywomen's volleyball's all-time career leader in assists. With her 41 assists on the night, Miles increased her career assist total to 5,741, besting the record set by Natalie Schonefeld of 5,732 in 2011."It's a really cool honor that reflects what this program as a whole has done these last four years and[what] the people that have been a part of it have done," Miles said.After a successful opening round to the tournament, the Eagles faced off against a formidableBirmingham-Southern University (Ala.) squad that had taken down the University of Chicago (Ill.) 3-1 in the previous round. The Birmingham-Southern Panthers were seeking vengeance on the Eagles, having been overpowered 3-0 in the teams' previous matchup on Sept. 1st at the Woodruff Physical Education Center (WoodPEC). However, Emory took down Birmingham-Southern handedly 3-1 (25-13, 23-25, 2521, 25-23).Superior hitting again led the Eagles a victory.

Junior mid hitter Jessica Holler joined Dzurik with double-digit kills, putting up 12 with a .370 hittingpercentage. Miles again finished as the assists leader of the team, ending the match with 47 and increasing her career total to 5,788.With the convincing victory over Birmingham-Southern, the Eagles moved on to the NCAA RegionalFinal. Here, they faced their toughest test of the season, Hendrix College, for a chance at the tournamenttitle.The first set, which Emory lost 25-23, was a tight, but the second set proved to be even tighter.The set seesawed from a 7-2 Hendrix lead to an 11-10 Hendrix lead to a 21-19 Emory lead after 40points of play. After 49 points, it was set point for Hendrix at 25-24 before two quick Emory scores flippedthe set point arrow towards the Eagles. However, Hendrix strung together three straight points to robEmory of the second set, giving themselves a 2-0 lead in the match."We simply weren't willing to let our season be over," Miles said.Behind Dzurik's five kills in the third set, including three during a span, the Eagles were able to fight back and win the third set, forcing a fourth.In the fourth set, two 4-0 runs allowed the Eagles to dominate and force a fifth and deciding set. Hendrixwas up 15-13 and 20-18 at two different points of the set, but the Eagles point surges brought the momentum back to their side.Those who stuck around in the Cage Center got their moneys worth in the incredibly exciting decidingset. After Emory tied the game at 7 points apiece, Hendrix proceeded to go on a 5-0 run to presumablyend the game for good.The relentlessness of Maher and the Eagles, who scored four unanswered points to make the score 1211, pulled them back into the game. However, Emory's luck ran out there. After Hendrix responded with two unanswered of their own and a Dzurik kill and block assists from Holler and Dzurik, Hendrix closedout the game 15-13."In the end, things didn't fall our way," Miles said. "Although we fell short of our goals, I think the most important part is that we enjoyed the time we had together and that's all you can ask for in the end."The Eagles finished the season with a 34-4 record, including a conference record of 7-0.
