Much to their dismay, Hawks small forwardDeAndre' Bembry fouled Pacers point guard Edmond Sumner on a 3-point attempt with 0.3 secondsremaining, and Sumner sank all three free throws to give the Pacers a 135-134 win.Hawks Head Coach Lloyd Pierce noted the heart breaking nature of the loss but said that he had wanted the entire team to have a chance to play in the final game of the season."It was an exciting game; we didn't come out on top, but that is how it works in sports," Pierce explained."There's no moral victory for us in this last game, but I wanted everyone to be part of it in some form orfashion."Although the Hawks lost, they had a terrific offensive outing. Atlanta shot 41.5 percent from three, scored52 points in the paint and converted 33 second chance points. Furthermore, each member of the A tlantastarting five scored in double figures including Prince, rookie point guard Trae Young, first-year shootingguard Kevin Huerter, sophomore power forward John Collins and veteran center Alex Len. Young,Collins and Len each recorded a double-double, posting 23 points and 11 assists, 20 points and 25rebounds and 20 points and 10 rebounds, respectively.On the defensive end, both teams played physically.

"You have to mentally and physically prepare yourself to do so. The level of physical ity that they face â€” we want to come back and be the aggressor next year."With two projected lottery picks and approximately $40 million in cap space for salaries, the Hawks enterthe off-season looking to grow stronger, improve defensively, accumulate new talent and continue building on their strong culture. These components, combined with the development of young guns likeYoung and Collins, point to a very bright future in Atlanta.The post Pacers Down Hawks With Last Second Free Throws appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
