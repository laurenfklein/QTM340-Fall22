"Georgia Tech beat us, but I think we swam over what their expectations for us were," he said.The Eagles are now preparing for the University Athletic Association (UAA) Championships on Feb. 1720 hosted at the University of Rochester (NY). Both teams will be seeking their 18th consecutive UAAwin, the women looking for their 24th overall and the men for 18th overall. The same weekend, however,many Emory swimmers will be back at Sewanee for their last chance to improve their times before theNCAA Division III Championships held in March.Lui is heading to the UAA's, but said it doesn't really matter which meet swimmers go to. "The overallgoal is to swim fast and have fun, which can happen anywhere, whether it be at Sewanee of the UAA's."Harwick added that the teams are looking to continue the tradition they've had at the UAA's, and use the competition as a test run for NCAA's. "But we're just taking it one meet at a time," he said.
