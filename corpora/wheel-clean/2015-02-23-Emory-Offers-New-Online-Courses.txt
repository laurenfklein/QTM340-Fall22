UNC Chapel Hill students can enroll in more than 70 different Carolina Courses Online (CCO) classes for credit in the fall, spring and summer.Wash U, on the other hand, offers six on line courses and six hybrid courses, which meet several times over the course of the session, during the summer. UC Berkeley Extension offers at least 150 onlineclasses, both fixed-date courses, which include specific start and finish dates, and continuous enrollmentcourses, which require 30 to 180 days to complete.Gouzoules said she hopes to see the number of available ECO courses multiply over the next year, with15 to 16 courses available for the summer of 2016.Two of the up coming summer ECO classes are Baseball and American Culture (AMST 322W/ENG389W) and Drugs and Behavior (PSYC 323), which were offered through Semester Online during the2013-2014 academic year, according to Korski. The other four upcoming courses, Culture and Society(SOC 221), Biochemistry I (BIOL 301), Human Physiology (BIOL 336) and Sociology of Sex and Gender(SOC 225), are currently being developed by their respective instructors with the help of Emory’s Centerfor Interactive Teaching (ECIT), Korski said. English Professor William Gruber, who taught Baseball and American Culture through both Semester Online and ECO, said he hardly changed his course between the two programs. Still, Gruber said he had to adjust the semester-long class to fit it into the six-weeksummer session by trimming down readings and eliminating weekly quizzes.Gruber, who retired in 2013 but still teaches online, said he loves the online platform, as he can interact with students more easily and better remember their names.“The Semester Online people used to claim in advance that there’s no back row, and I’ve found that’strue — you do feel in some ways like you’re really part of a group,” Gruber said, adding that 12 students have already enrolled in his class.Gruber and Oxford College Professor Jennifer McGee, who, along with Goodrich C. White Professor of Psychology Darryl Neill, taught Drugs and Behavior for both E CO and Semester Online, said they miss the latter platform’s ability to connect them with students at other schools.“This could be a really good thing, because you get people from all kinds of different backgrounds,”McGee said. However, she said she found that the online platform allowed for less interaction with students than she would have with a regular, in-person class setting, which she saw as a negativefactor. McGee also noted that, unlike ECO, Semester Online was not available to Oxford Collegestudents.“At Oxford, a lot of the complaints we hear are that [students] have a hard time taking courses for theirmajors, and this can help with that,” she said.College junior Joshua Niemtzow, who took Gruber’s course through E CO in the fall, said the class was one of his favorites that he had taken at Emory.“I wouldn’t say the on line setting was a plus, but it was a very good on line program,” Niemtzow said. He added that he had a decent amount of contact with Gruber and the 12 other students taking the course.For weekly video discussions, he said, 11 to 12 of the students would consistently participate.“It’s great for a lot of different purposes,” Niemtzow said of the online platform. “If you’re at home, if you have to take a semester off, if you have work, you can do the class work on your own time.”College junior Hunar Amedi, another student who will be taking Gruber’s course this summer, agreed.“During the first summer session, I’ll be working at an internship, and during the second one, I’ll betraveling, so this is perfect for me,” Amedi said.— By Lydia O’Neal, Asst.
