The 2018 Homecoming parade was canceled due to potential rain, according to the Emory AlumniAssociation's website."There wasn't any way to have this event as it is 100 percent outdoors, with paper floats, golf carts, etc.,"Student Programming Council President Abbey Kelly (19B) told the Wheel. "However, if we can find another way to plan an event that show cases our student organizations, we will do that. We are also super disappointed, as a lot of planning and logistic heavy work went into this on the SPC side."SPC, Campus Life and Emory Alumni Association decided to cancel the parade at 9 a.m, according toKelly.The parade is an annual tradition in which students, alumni, faculty and staff walk through campus withthemed groups.Residence Hall Association President Aaron Jordan (20C) said RH A had more than 100 hall councilmembers working on 10 floats for the parade. The hall councils had started planning and working on them about one month ago and put in "countless of hours," Jordan said.In lieu of the parade, RHA hosted a smaller event where the floats traveled from the parking deck belowLongstreet-Means Hall to Eleanor Raoul Hall and back. Some SPC members and Residence Life alumnijudged the students' decorations."They still got to have that short feel of recognition, but it wasn't like everyone who was planning to come to the parade," Jordan said.Courtesy of RHAJordan added that, for the future, SPC and RH A should have contingency plans for weather."There wasn't any communication for what's the contingency plan," Jordan said. "For RHA, it reallywasn't an option to do a last-minute cancel because of how much work was put in."The Saturday concert featuring Keri Hilson (03Ox, 05C) will start as scheduled at 2 p.m. rain or shine,according to the website.UPDATE (10/20/18 at 10:37 a.m.): The article has been updated with additional information from Kelly.UPDATE (10/21/18 at 11:53 a.m.): The article has been updated with comment from Jordan.The post Homecoming Parade Canceled Due to Potential Rain appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
