Senior Lukas Mees was one of several Eagles who had a strong showing at the VertKlasse Meeting thispast weekend. | Courtesy of Emory AthleticsEmory's track and field team sent a number of athletes to the VertKlasse Meeting held at High PointUniversity (N.C.) this past weekend. This type of event is unique given that it tends to put a small number of top level athletes against each other. Despite the high level of competition, several Eagles stillmanaged to shine. Head Coach John Curtin said that the event, the first away even t of the outdoor trackseason, offered its fair share of obstacles."Not only was this our first away meet of the season, but it was a long trip as well," Curtin said. "Theconditions, especially the wind, made it a really tough event to run well at. Some events we did better than others in, and those tended to be the ones earlier in the day, when the weather was better."On the women's side, senior Julie Williamson placed ninth in the 800m run with a time of 2:13.99. Hertime was the sixth fastest in Emory's history. Sophomore Gabrielle Stravach also competed in the 800mand finished 14th overall. Several other Eagles also posted season-best marks including freshmenAbigail Hotaling and Paris Wagner and sophomore Valerie Linck. Hotaling placed seventh overall in the3,000m Steeplechase thanks to her 11:26.72 time. Wagner's throw of 34.04m in the discus earned her27th place, and Linck finished 26th with a distance of 11.44m in the shot put. Freshman Amanda Martinplaced fourth in the 5,000m run with a time of 18:06.30. Freshman Dani Bland ran the best 100m dash forEmory, earning 16th place with a time of 12.30. While Curtin was impressed with all his athletes, but especially so with Hotaling's."Given all the things working against runners at this meet, to run a 12-second personal best is fantastic,"Curtin said. "She ran very well and smart, but most of all she hurdled extremely well."Senior Lukas Mees headlined a solid effort on the men's side. Mees posted the third fastest time in Emory history in the 3,000m Steeplechase, 9:18.37, which was good enough for third overall.Sophomore Shane Sullivan ran Emory's fastest 5,000m this season, with a time of 14:54.34.

"It's a smaller meet with smaller schools, so we're really looking for our team to come out per form and well."
