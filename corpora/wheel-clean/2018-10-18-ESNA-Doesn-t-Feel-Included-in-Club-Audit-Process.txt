Caroline Silva (22C) was previouslyconfirmed, the Wheel previously reported. SGA Vice President John Priddy (19C) holds the third studentseat on the University Senate.SGA President Dwight M a (17Ox, 19C) and Executive Vice President John Priddy (19C) recommendedDoze, who is an intern for the Emory Commission on Racial and Social Justice. Within the commission,Doze has also served on the Social Justice Education Committee, which analyzes University policies to better integrate social justice on campus."I was just really impressed with Mariah during the interview," Priddy said. "The credentials she put up forherself, she will do amazing work on the University Senate."SGA Initiates Referendum to Create New Exec PositionSGA voted unanimously to pass Bill 52sl33, which will send a referendum to all undergraduate students to create a permanent SGA deputy vice president of communications position. The legislature approved the bill last week, but the SGA Constitution requires legislators to pass proposed constitutional amendment in two legislative sessions with a two-thirds majority.SGA Vice President of Communications Tiffany Haas (19C) explained at SGA's last meeting that SGAneeds a deputy position because there are lots of duties involved in effective communication and full transparency with the student body.SGA did not contact all undergraduate students regarding the proposed amendment to the Constitution,as required by the SGA Constitution. SGA Speaker of the House Lori Steffel (21C) told the Wheel last week that holding public meetings and making information publicly available satisfies the notification requirements of the Constitution.SGA Denies Summit Funding RequestSGA Chair of International Affairs Candice He (21C) proposed Bill 52sl35, which would grant $300 for the Emory International Leadership Summit to fund a meal for leaders of Emory's cultural clubs. The Summitaims to provide Emory's cultural clubs and international organizations the opportunity collaborate oncelebrating global diversity, according to the bill. The bill initially tied with five votes in favor and five votesagainst, but Steffel casted a tie-breaking vote against the funding measure.SGA Vice President of Finance Paul Park (17Ox, 19B) saids SGA's budget is already tight because it funds other services."We are on a very tight budget," Park said. "While this is a great idea, the overall money that goes intoservicing the shuttles, etc., and transportation serves the overall greater Emory community."Priddy expressed concerns about the precedent that passing the bill would set, although SGA voted to fund $224.70 for the summit last year. Ma, who was then SGA vice president of international affairs,proposed the bill."Think about the precedent you would set when you say yes to funding certain things cause other clubs will come in and say you funded that, so why won't you vote to fund ours," Priddy said.The post ESNA 'Doesn't Feel Included' in Club Audit Process appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
