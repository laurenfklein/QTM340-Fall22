"Our play is as competitive as it has ever been. We have really good players and in order to get into that top five position we have to be ready to play every day."Next weekend's competition, Hickton said, will be a "test of patience."The tournament will provide Emory with some tough competition, as 16 of the top 25 D-III teams will be in attendance, according to Sjoberg."[Our next tournament] will be one of the biggest tournaments of the year," Hickton said. "It will be a big challenge because a lot of the tournaments we play are two days, this will be a three-day tournament andnationals will be a four-day."On March 17, the Eagles entered the Oglethorpe Spring Invitational in Jekyll Island, Fla.
