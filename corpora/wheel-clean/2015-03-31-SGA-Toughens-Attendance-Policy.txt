This bill … seeks to take very drastic action.”SGA members engaged in a lengthy debate over the bill. Some questioned whether it was necessary,and others wondered whether it would be effective.“We just have to be logical about [attendance] … and having some one keeping track of it,” GoizuetaBusiness School junior and SGA Junior Representative Luke Bucshon​ said. “I don’t think it’s something that we necessarily have to enforce harder.”Several SGA members from graduate school divisions expressed concerns about the use of proxies,which is common throughout SGA but especially prevalent among graduate student representatives.Some graduate student representatives argued that it was unreasonable for members to be required to attend every meeting; therefore, as long as representatives made sure that a proxy attended in theirplace, graduate representatives argued, they should not be punished.SGA responded by amending the bill to say that the Speaker of the Legislature would have very broad discretion to excuse members from meetings, so that as long as members made reasonable efforts to fulfill their responsibilities, they would not be subject to penalties. The amendment also gave the speaker the final say on whether or not to expel members.Furthermore, SGA included in the amendment that the speaker must email members who have accrued three or four absences to remind them of the attendance policy. Expelled members will have the opportunity to appeal their removal during the next meeting of the Legislature.The amendment passed by a unanimous vote, and the bill passed as well by a vote of 16-3-2.Gender-Neutral BathroomSGA President and College junior Jon Darby then submitted Bill 48sl28, which requested that SGAprovide financial support for the construction of a gender-neutral restroom and changing facility within the George W. Woodruff Physical Education Center (WoodPEC).“The reason I wrote this bill is to demonstrate to the student body that this is a cause that SGA caresabout,” Darby said. He added that SG A also pushed the amendment “to sort of shame the University because this type of project is something the University as a whole should fund, but they’ve beenunwilling to put up money.”The bill proposed that SGA allocate $10,000 to the project, which in total will cost over $100,000 and will be paid for by the WoodPEC. Darby referenced the approval in a University-wide referendum of a recentSGA amendment to remove gender-binary enforcing language from the SGA constitution, and he said that this event showed the widespread support among students for gender inclusion.Darby submitted the SGA gender inclusion amendment, which eliminated all instances of pronouns,such as “he” or “she,” that impose a gender binary. SGA passed the amendment by a two-thirds voteand 65 percent of the student body.According to Darby, the rest room will be on the first floor of the WoodPEC, and it will include a shower and a changing bench.“If students believe that this is an important cause and are willing to put up their money for it, then the University should do it too,” Darby said. “Our contribution is more than symbolic. We’re investing ininclusion.”SGA members overwhelmingly supported the bill, although many of them questioned why $10,000 was needed to show that SGA was in favor of the move.“By putting this money in, I don’t think we’re making an impact on the construction itself,” Vice President for Finance and College senior Patrick O’Leary said. “We could make this symbolic gesture with a smaller amount of money.”In response to O’Leary’s comment, SGA amended the bill to reflect the majority of SGA members’desire to change the contribution amount from $10,000 to $5,000.SGA passed both the amendment and the bill.— By Luke White, Senior Staff Writer
