She and several other selected finalists then auditioned for the position by revising their original address for a five-minute speech before the committee.For her address, Berman said she reached out to 50 seniors involved in various campus groups and asked them questions about their feelings toward the University as a way to draw on their experiences and produce a more wholesome, comprehensive speech.Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Joanne Brzinski and College of Arts and SciencesDean Robin Forman informed Ber man that the committee had chosen her as the class orator on March25.Since her audition, Berman said, she has reorganized the discussion to focus on what most seniorsbelieved to be the most dynamic aspect of the Emory community.“The major responses were social justice, decreased amount of apathy and increased school spirit —not Emory as a whole, but for a lot of smaller communities within Emory,” she said. “When I revised thespeech, it became a lot more organic and had a lot more weight.”Berman is a member of Omicron Delta Kappa and Mortar Board honor societies and Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. She has served as president, vice president and treasurer of Emory Model UnitedNations; an Orientation Leader and Orientation Captain; an executive member of the Jewish studentorganization Hillel and a research fellow for the Center for the Study of Law, Policy and Economics,according to the release.
