The meet featured 14 events and the women claimed first place ineight.In the field events, freshmen Kaitlyn Iwanowicz and Isabel Saridakis took first in the long jump and polevault, respectively.

Harper cleared the bar at 3.66m in the pole vault and finished the 110m hurdles with a time of18.66."I was very pleased with my pole vaulting," Harper said. "But honestly for us, how we do relative to other teams at normal meets doesn't really matter. We really try to just get those personal bests and use the meets as good practice so we perform well where it counts like at UAAs."The UAA Outdoor Championships on April 22 to 23 at the University of Chicago (Ill.) will give some of the Eagles a chance to qualify for NCAA Division III Championships May 25-27."The support the team gives each other really makes a huge difference at UAAs because the whole team is there," Harper said. "That is really where it turns from an individual sport to more of a team sport.Your team being there and cheering you on puts on a lot of pressure to do well. Even if some athletesdon't score they will probably PR just because [of] all the energy present at the meet."
