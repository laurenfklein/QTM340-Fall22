Tigers on Sept. 25 for a highadrenaline match in which Emory came out ahead at 4-0, their fourth straight shut out and eighth consecutive victory. With their first-place rank in the conference (tied with the University of Rochester(N.Y.)) safe yet again, the Eagles' red-hot start to the season is not losing any steam.

Keerthana Sivaramakrishnan/Staff[/caption] Neither team found any shots for the first 10 minutes of the game, at which point the pacing shifted. The Eagles rocked four shots on goal before any answer from the Tigers. At 27 minutes remaining in the first half, senior midfielder AidanDatene scored the first goal of the game for Emory off a post-corner kick skirmish. Only seven minuteslater, junior midfielder Jun Tsuru followed with a jaw-dropping goal, gracefully tapping the ball past theSewanee goalkeeper after a breakaway. The game continued with a noticeable increase in aggression from the Tigers that was quickly matched by the Eagles. Though few penalties were called in total, elbowswings and toe jabs began to look more intentional as the first half went on. A trip near the goal line gavejunior midfielder Keegan McCombie a penalty kick, which he promptly sank into the net.

After only 10 minutes,the Eagles put up their fourth goal of the game. A corner kick from Tsuru found junior midfielder WilliamJones, who took a shot that went wide. Senior midfielder Tyler Walsh then recovered the ball and placed a follow-up shot into the back-left corner of the goal. Perhaps the night's most remarkable statistic was that the game marked the Eagles' sixth shut out this season. With only five goals allowed in their eight games so far this season, there is no question Emory's defensive formula is effective.

Keerthana Sivaramakrishnan/Staff[/caption] "The chemistry between the team is reallyhigh," sophomore starting goalkeeper Cole Gallagher said. "Also, the confidence is there. We do have a young back line, but through these first eight games of the season you've seen a total change inconfidence. … It's our confidence and our ability to do the small things really well, and the big things willfollow." Overall, neither half saw any shortage of questionable play from the teams. Even the energy from the side lines felt tense as players pushed and prodded both each other and the limits of the referee.Even with an unremarkable final penalty count, it seemed as though both teams toed the line with theirphysicality.

"We can rely on both our physicality and our technicality," Santee said."We're one of the most technical teams in the nation. We can play around teams. … Not only can we match teams with physicality, but we can match them and beat them with our technicality as well." TheEagles will travel to play Washington University in St. Louis (Mo.) on Sept. 29 at noon.The post Team Snags Eighth Victory of Season appeared first on The Emory Wheel.
