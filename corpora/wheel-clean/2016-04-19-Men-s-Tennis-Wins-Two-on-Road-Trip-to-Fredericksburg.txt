Emory won both matches: 72 against Johns Hopkins and 9-0 against Mary Washington.To start off the weekend, Emory defeated Johns Hopkins 7-2. The Eagles won five of six singles matchups and two of three doubles match-ups. Among those winners were senior Rafe Mosetick andfreshman Jonathan Jemison, both of whom are undefeated separately in singles and together in doubles."We know we are the best two doubles team in the country," Jemison said. "It's just a matter of stayingfocused."The Eagles carried that momentum into the next day, beating Mary Washington 9-0. They delivered an impressive performance, winning all of their match-ups in both singles and doubles. Mosetick andJemison won their matches in doubles and singles play. Sophomore duo David Omsky and Andrew Harrington were also successful for the second day in a row in doubles.The Eagles' mindset was to stick to their winning principles regardless of the level of the competition."They are lower-ranked, so they are not really that big of a threat, but at the same time if you don't focus,you can get in a very tight match quickly," Jemison said.Emory concluded the week end with a record of 16-3 for the season, 14-0 in Division III play. They will take on Washington and Lee University (Va.) Tuesday, April 19.Rafe Mosetick on his undefeated season so far, " Honestly it's all about preparation and focus, this is my last year and I'm trying to make it my best."
