Emory Greek organizations collaborated to host an interactive program on issues of dating abuse and sexual assault in White Hall yesterday, Thursday, Oct. 23.The event, titled “Safe Smart Dating” hosted by Emory’s Sigma Delta Tau (SDT) sorority and Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) fraternity, was part of a broader program offered by the national chapter of SDT in partnership with Jewish Women International (JWI) and the national ZBT chapter.Emory is the first university to host a full-length Safe Smart Dating program — until now, only three pilotprograms had been tested at universities since the program’s launch last year.Upon entering the auditorium, the event’s more than 100 participants were assigned to smaller, peer-leddiscussion groups.Representatives from JW I and the ZBT national chapter led a presentation about different types of abuse found in college relationships and dealing with cases of assault.After the facilitators explained a particular issue, participants split up into their small groups. Theattendees were given news articles and hypothetical scenarios, as well as shown videos to sparkdiscussions in the groups.“It’s an engaging conversation that has [participants] not just listening to a lecture but has them actually participating in how you would address these situations,” National President of SDT Michelle Carlsonsaid.Another interactive feature of the program was the live-text surveys. Upon describing the different types of dating abuse, the presenters put up a poll asking attendees whether they had experienced any kind of dating abuse, and if so, what kind.Participants could text in their responses anonymously and see how people in the room answered on the screen in real-time.“It was really sobering to see the numbers in your own community as opposed to just random statistics,”College senior Jamie Shulman said. “I think it was really eye-opening for specifically Emory campus and what goes on here.”College senior and President of Emory’s SDT chapter Lindsay Baker, worked with the national SDTchapter to bring the Safe Smart Dating program to campus. She said she felt there wasn’t enoughengagement from the Emory community on issues of sexual assault.“There’s not a lot of public things going on in response to sexual violence on campus, especially within the Greek community,” Baker said. “We wanted to really be the pioneers and do something about it instead of just sitting back.”Carlson noted that the Safe Smart Dating program was unique in that it engages both men and women,and that this effort is coming from Greek organizations.“There’s a lot of negative stereotypes about Greek men and Greek women,” Carlson explained. “Wehave an opportunity to be leaders in this area of domestic violence to work together and make a difference on college campuses.”The program was also LGBT-friendly. The hypothetical scenarios discussed at the event deliberatelyused characters with gender-neutral names so that they could apply to all types of relationships.“It is really inclusive of all types of relationships, in the sense that it’s not just your typical male-femalerelationship,” College senior and President of Emory’s ZBT chapter Sam Broida said. “It’s sort of an allencompassing, overarching review of how to handle any kind of relationship.”Drew Rizzo, health promotion specialist for Emory’s Respect program, and Catherine Petersen, anemployee of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), were also on hand to provide counselingfor any students who may have felt uncomfortable by any of the issues discussed in the program.— By Harmeet Kaur, Digital Editor
