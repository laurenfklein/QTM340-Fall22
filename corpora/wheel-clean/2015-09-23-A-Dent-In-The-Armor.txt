The first-ranked Emory women's volley ball team lost a pair of games last week end on the final day of the Emory National Invitational.The Eagles fell 3-1 (25-17, 25-19, 18-25, 25-18) to Calvin College (Mich.) and 3-2 (21-25, 29-31, 25-20,25-21, 15-7) to Claremont-Mudd-Scripps College (Calif.), posting a 12-2 season standing."It was an amazing weekend of volleyball, [with] five of the very best teams in the country participating,"Head Coach Jenny McDowell wrote in an email to the Wheel. "It was a privilege to host such an amazingevent; literally a preview of the potential NCAA Final Eight.Despite a strong performance by older members of the team, including junior Sarah Maher, who led the team with 12 kills, and junior Jessica Holler, who hit a season-high percentage of .526, the CalvinKnights outhit Emory with a .285 hitting percentage and stole the victory.The Eagles, however, flexed some muscle. Holler clocked only one error in 19 attempts, and seniorSydney Miles had 35 assists, landing her a No.2 spot in the program's all-time list in the category."Obviously the matches didn't go as planned, but it showed us some areas that we can improve upon,"Miles said.While the loss to the Knights was unexpected, the team's prospects for the rest of the season are strong given their previous 36-game winning streak."We had moments of playing great volley ball but some moments of not playing our best," McDowell said."I am confident we will respond well and get better."The second game of the day brought another defeat for the Eagles, who fell to the offense-heavyAthenas.Holler continued to deliver a high hitting percentage (.429) and tied junior Kathryn Trinka for 15terminations. Miles also broke personal records with a season-high 57 assists, and freshman KarissaDzurik led the team with a season-high 16 terminations."We are definitely still top contenders even with the losses, and I honestly think it will make us even better at the end of the season," Miles said.Both McDowell and Miles agreed that they are optimistic about the rest of the Eagles' season."They are an amazing group, and I am excited to see all the great things we are going to accomplish thisseason," McDowell said.The Eagles will go head-to-head with third-ranked Christopher Newport University (Va.) this Friday at4:30 p.m.
