The dataset provides information about 2,000 films from 1925 to 2015, including characters’ names, genders, ages, how many words each character spoke in each film, the release year of each film, and how much money the film grossed. They included character gender information because they wanted to contribute data to a broader conversation about how \"white men dominate movie roles.\"\n","\n","Yet transforming complex social constructs like gender into quantifiable data is tricky and historically fraught. They claim, in fact, that one of the [most frequently asked questions](https://medium.com/@matthew_daniels/faq-for-the-film-dialogue-by-gender-project-40078209f751) about the piece is about gender: “Wait, but let’s talk about gender. How do you know the monster in Monsters Inc. is a boy!\" The short answer is that they don't. To determine character gender, they used actors' IMDB information, which they acknowledge is an imperfect approach: \"Sometimes, women voice male characters. Bart Simpson, for example, is voiced by a woman. We’re aware that this means some of the data is wrong, AND we’re still fine with the methodology and approach.\"\n","\n","While approaches like this are often the best we can do, it's still worth stoping to ask: what do we lose because of these reductive approaches to gender? What harms might they bring about, and are there cases where the harms outweigh the benefits?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2MOkF4Iqo0vl"},"source":["## Import Pandas"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"rhVgK1rro0vn"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bPkkzpbDo0vo"},"source":["## Set Display Settings"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-Yen2El7o0vo"},"source":["By default, Pandas will display 60 rows and 20 columns.
