Everyone with email relies on classification to separate spam from legitimate emails. Email providers train classification models to recognize the difference by giving them emails they have labeled “spam” and “not spam.” They then ask the model to learn the features that most reliably distinguish the two types, which could include a preponderance of all caps or phrases like “free money” or “get paid.” They test the model by giving it unlabeled emails and asking it to classify them.
